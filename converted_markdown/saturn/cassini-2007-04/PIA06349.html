Evidence from the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer on the Cassini
spacecraft indicates that the grain sizes in Saturn's rings grade from smaller
to larger, related to distance from Saturn. Those data (right) are shown next
to a corresponding picture of the rings taken by Cassini's narrow angle
camera.

Saturn's rings are thought to be made up of boulder-size snowballs. By looking
at the rings with the visual and infrared mapping spectrometer, the size of
the ice crystals, or grains, on the surfaces of those boulders can be
determined.

This visual and infrared mapping spectrometer has a spatial resolution similar
to that of the human eye, so it provides a view analogous to standing on the
spacecraft. Only instead of looking at the rings in visible wavelengths, the
instrument sees wavelengths beyond what human eyes can see, ranging from the
ultraviolet to the infrared.

The latest observations show that grain sizes range from very small, like
powdery snow on Earth, to larger grains, like more granular snow.

The visual and infrared mapping spectrometer can also see the fingerprint
signatures of chemical bonds, and, in this case, it spotted the bonds of
frozen water molecules. Saturn's rings are made mostly of water in the form of
ice. While this has been known for many years, the Cassini data are showing
that the ring ice is more pure than previously thought, with the most pure
ices generally being observed at increasing distances from Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The visual
and infrared mapping spectrometer team is based at the University of Arizona,
Tucson, Ariz.
