Saturn's ring-embedded moons, Pan and Daphnis, are captured in a single
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle frame in an alignment they repeat with the
regularity of a precise cosmic clock. Pan is closer to Saturn, and thus orbits
faster, and Pan overtakes Daphnis every 19 days.

The flying-saucer-like shape of Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across) can
easily be discerned here. Daphnis (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across) is a
mere speck, although its presence is made obvious by the edge waves it creates
in the surrounding ring material.

Pan also raises waves in the edges of the Encke Gap (see
[PIA06099](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06099)). However, even
though Pan is more massive than Daphnis, Pan is farther from the edges of its
gap than the smaller moon. This causes Pan's edge waves to have a much longer
wavelength (they are more stretched out) and a smaller amplitude (they do not
extend as far inward from the gap edge) as those created by Daphnis, making
them more difficult to see.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 24 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 24, 2007 at a distance of approximately 889,000 kilometers
(553,000 miles) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 21 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
