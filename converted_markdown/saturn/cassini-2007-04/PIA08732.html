This false-color mosaic of Saturn shows deep-level clouds silhouetted against
Saturn's glowing interior. The image was made with data from Cassini's visual
and infrared mapping spectrometer, which can image the planet at 352 different
wavelengths.

This mosaic shows the entire planet, including features like Saturn's ring
shadows and the terminator, the boundary between day and night.

The data were obtained in February 2006 at a distance of 1.6 million
kilometers (1 million miles) from directly over the plane of Saturn's rings,
which appear here as a thin, blue line over the equator. The image was
constructed from images taken at wavelengths of 1.07 microns shown in blue,
2.71 microns shown in green, and 5.02 microns shown in red.

The blue-green color (lower right) is sunlight scattered off clouds high in
Saturn's atmosphere and the red color (upper left) is the glow of thermal
radiation from Saturn's warm interior, easily seen on Saturn's night side (top
left), within the shadow of the rings, and with somewhat less contrast on
Saturn's day side (bottom right). The darker areas within Saturn show the
strongest thermal radiation. The bright red color indicates areas where
Saturn's atmosphere is relatively clear. The great variety of cloud shapes and
sizes reveals a surprisingly active planet below the overlying sun-scattering
haze.

The brighter glow of the northern hemisphere versus the southern indicates
that the clouds and hazes there are noticeably thinner than those in the
south. Scientists speculate that this is a seasonal effect, and if so, it will
change as the northern hemisphere enters springtime during the next few years.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The Visual and Infrared
Mapping Spectrometer team is based at the University of Arizona where this
image was produced.
