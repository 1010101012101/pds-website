Epimetheus floats in the distance below center, showing only the barest hint
of its irregular shape. Pandora hides herself in the ringplane, near upper
right, appearing as little more than a bump.

This view is from just above the ringplane and shows features on the unlit
side of Saturn's rings.

Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across) and Pandora (84 kilometers, or
52 miles across) hug the outer reaches of Saturn's main rings. Pandora orbits
just outside the F ring, and Epimetheus jockeys for position with Janus,
10,000 kilometers beyond. Janus and Epimetheus recently swapped positions, and
Janus will remain the innermost of the pair until 2010, when they will swap
positions again.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 29, 2006, at a distance of approximately 3.3 million
kilometers (2 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is approximately 20
kilometers (12 miles) per pixel at the distance of Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
