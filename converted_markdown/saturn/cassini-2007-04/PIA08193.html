Cassini finds artistic harmony in the dark and icy realm of Saturn. The view
shows the crescent of Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) and the
outer edge of Saturn's main rings.

The dim, unlit side of the rings is shown here. The narrow F ring appears
bright when seen from angles near the plane of the rings. Saturn's shadow
engulfs the rings along their near edge.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on April 29, 2006 at a distance of approximately 884,000 kilometers
(549,000 miles) from Tethys. Image scale is 53 kilometers (33 miles) per pixel
on Tethys.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
