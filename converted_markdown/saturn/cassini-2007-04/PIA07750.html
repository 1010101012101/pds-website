This mosaic of 15 Cassini images of Saturn's F ring shows how the moon
Prometheus creates a gore in the ring once every 14.7 hours, as it approaches
and recedes from the F ring on its eccentric orbit.

The individual images have been processed to make the ring appear as if it has
been straightened, making it easier to see the ring's structure. The mosaic
shows a region 147,000 kilometers (91,000 miles) along the ring (horizontal
direction in the image); this represents about 60 degrees of longitude around
the ring. The region seen here is about 1,500 kilometers (900 miles) across
(vertical direction). The first and last images in the mosaic were taken
approximately 2.5 hours apart.

Each dark channel, or "gore," is clearly visible across more than 1,000
kilometers (600 miles) of the ring and is due to the gravitational effect of
Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across), even though the moon does not
enter the F ring. The channels have different tilts because the ring particles
closer to Prometheus (overexposed, stretched, and just visible at the bottom
right of the image) move slower with respect to the moon than those farther
away. This causes the channels to shear with time, their slopes becoming
greater, and gives the overall visual impression of drapes of ring material.
The channels at the right are the youngest and have near-vertical slopes,
while those at the left are the oldest and have near-horizontal slopes.

This phenomenon has not previously been detected in any other planetary ring
system, but computer simulations of the system prove that the disturbance is
caused by a simple gravitational interaction. The eccentric orbit of
Prometheus is gradually moving so that the moon will eventually come even
closer in its closest approach to the eccentric F ring. Scientists calculate
that its perturbations of the F ring will reach a maximum in December 2009.

The images in this mosaic were taken using the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 13, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.1 million
kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. The resolution in the original images,
before reprojection, was 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
