A group of bright spokes tightly cluster together in Saturn's B ring. The
spokes seen here generally all exhibit the same degree of shearing, or
tilting, but some deviations are apparent. In this image, the direction to
Saturn is downward; orbital motion is to the left.

Ring scientists are eager for data to help them understand and eventually
explain how these mysterious ring features are created. To that end, Cassini
has been directed to acquire movie sequences, like the one this image is part
of, that watch for these elusive radial structures.

This observation focused on the morning side of the rings, the side where the
rings are rotating out from Saturn's shadow. Spokes appear most frequently at
this location.

Also barely visible in this image are broader, much fainter but still bright
radial regions that extend over larger radial distances than the spokes in the
upper left. Where these fainter features cross ringlets in the lower part of
the image, slight variations in brightness are apparent. These are probably
due to tiny particles, possibly part of a former spoke, that haven't yet
settled down onto the ring plane.

Although their formation is still a subject of inquiry, scientists are
confident that the microscopic spoke particles are slightly electrically
charged and therefore are influenced by Saturn's magnetic field.

The brightness of the spokes, when combined with viewing geometry information
and estimates of their particle sizes can help researchers determine the
amount of material in the spokes--a crucial quantity to constrain theories of
spoke formation.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 28, 2006, at a distance of approximately 1.3 million
kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 147 degrees. Scale in the original image was about 32
kilometers (20 miles) per pixel. The view has been magnified by a factor of
two.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
