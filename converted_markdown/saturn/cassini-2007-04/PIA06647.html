Saturn's moon Dione occults part of Saturn's distant rings while Tethys hovers
below. Dione is 1,118 kilometers (695 miles) across, while Tethys is 1,071
kilometers, 665 miles) across.

This image offers excellent contrast with a previously released view (see
[PIA06629](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06629)) that showed the
bright, wispy markings on Dione's trailing hemisphere. The huge impact
structure Odysseus (450 kilometers, or 280 miles across) is near the limb of
Tethys. Compared with the battered surface of Tethys, Dione appears much
smoother from this distance.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 19, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.7 million
kilometers (1.7 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is approximately
15 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
