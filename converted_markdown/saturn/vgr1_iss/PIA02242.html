This detailed mosaic of the underside of the Cassini Division was obtained by
Voyager 1 with a resolution of about 10 kilometers. The classical Cassini
Division appears here to the right of center as five bright rings with
substantial blacks gap on either side. The inner edge of the A Ring, to the
left of center, is the brightest part of this image. The fine-scale wave
structure in this region has been interpreted as being the result of
gravitational density waves.
