**Discovery of the Wavemaker**

Cassini's celestial sleuthing has paid off with this time-lapse series of
images which confirmed earlier suspicions that a small moon was orbiting
within the narrow Keeler gap of Saturn's rings.

The movie sequence, which consists of 12 images taken over 16 minutes while
Cassini gazed down upon the sunlit side of the A ring, shows a tiny moon
orbiting in the center of the Keeler gap, churning up waves in the gap edges
as it goes. The pattern of waves travels with the moon in its orbit.

The Keeler gap is located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) inside the outer
edge of the A ring, which is also the outer edge of the bright main rings. The
new object is about 7 kilometers across (4 miles) and reflects about 50
percent of the sunlight that falls upon it -- a brightness that is typical of
particles in the nearby rings.

The new body has been provisionally named S/2005 S1.

Imaging scientists predicted the moon's presence and its orbital distance from
Saturn after July 2004, when they saw a set of peculiar spiky and wispy
features in the Keeler gap's outer edge. The similarities of the Keeler gap
features to those noted in Saturn's F ring and the Encke gap led the
scientists to conclude that a small body, a few kilometers across, was lurking
in the center of the Keeler gap, awaiting discovery.

Also included here is a view of the same scene created by combining six
individual, unmagnified frames used in the movie sequence. This digital
composite view improves the overall resolution of the scene compared to that
available in any of the single images.

The images in this movie sequence were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on May 1, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.1 million
kilometers (708,000 miles) from Saturn. Resolution in the original image was 8
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel. The images in the movie sequence have been
magnified in (the vertical direction only) by a factor of two to aid
visibility of features caused within the gap by the moonlet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
