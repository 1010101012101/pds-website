Atlas and Pan emerge from the far side of Saturn. Light passing through the
upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere is refracted, or bent, distorting the
image of the rings beyond.

Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across) is seen within the Encke Gap. Atlas
(32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) orbits just beyond the outer edge of
Saturn's A ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 12
degrees above the ringplane. Shadows cast by the rings arc across the planet
toward the Cassini spacecraft.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 12, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers
(1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
