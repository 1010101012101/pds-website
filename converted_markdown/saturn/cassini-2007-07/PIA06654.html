The great eye of Saturn's moon Mimas, a 130-kilometer-wide (80-mile) impact
crater called Herschel, stares out from the battered moon. Several individual
ringlets within the F ring are resolved here, and the small moon Atlas is also
seen faintly outside the main rings.

Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles across); the view shows principally the
moon's anti-Saturn hemisphere. Atlas is 32 kilometers (20 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 5, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers
(1.3 million miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 72 degrees. The image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
