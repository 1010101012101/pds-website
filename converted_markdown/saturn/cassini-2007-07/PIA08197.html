The plumes of Enceladus continue to gush icy particles into Saturn orbit,
making this little moon one of a select group of geologically active bodies in
the solar system.

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is seen here against the night
side of Saturn. The extended exposure time used to image the plumes also makes
the southern hemisphere, illuminated by ring-shine, appear bright.

The image was acquired in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on May 4, 2006 at a distance of approximately 2.1 million
kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Enceladus and 2.3 million kilometers (1.5
million miles) from Saturn. The image was taken at a Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 159 degrees. Image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per
pixel on Enceladus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
