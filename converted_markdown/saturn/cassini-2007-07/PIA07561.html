Saturn's moon Epimetheus is seen here from just beneath the ring plane, along
with Saturn's intriguing F ring. The bright, knotted core of the F ring is
flanked on both sides by thin, dusty strands. The outer part of the A ring is
visible at the left. Epimetheus is 116 kilometers (72 miles) across.

Part of the little moon's night side is illuminated by reflected light from
the planet. For a closer view of Epimetheus see
[PIA06226](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06226).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 30, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.8 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Epimetheus and at a Sun-Epimetheus-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 93 degrees. Resolution in the original image was 11 kilometers
(7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
