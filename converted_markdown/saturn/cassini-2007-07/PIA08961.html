The Cassini spacecraft looks toward the unilluminated side of Saturn's rings
to spy on the moon Pan as it cruises through the Encke Gap.

This view looks toward the rings from about 13 degrees above the ringplane. At

Saturn's brilliant rings are accompanied here by a pack of small moons.

Visible in this view, from lower left to center right are Mimas (397
kilometers, or 247 miles across), Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across),
Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across) and Prometheus (102 kilometers, or
63 miles across). The narrow F ring lies between the latter two, which are its
"shepherd moons."

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 14
degrees above the ringplane. The planet's night side is visible through the
rings at left. Saturn's shadow stretches across the ringplane above center.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on April 29, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.9 million
kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 108 kilometers (67
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
