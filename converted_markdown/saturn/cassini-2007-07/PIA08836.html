This close-up of the inner edge of the Cassini Division shows an enormous
amount of structure, including a grainy texture in the bright outer B ring
material near the gap edge.

An extreme enhancement of the original image, presented at right, reveals the
grainy region with greater clarity.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 54 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 8, 2006 at a distance of approximately 378,000 kilometers
(235,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
68 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
