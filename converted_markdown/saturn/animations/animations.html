The Voyager 2 [ photopolarimeter (PPS)](/www/voyager/hardware/pps/pps.html)
and [ ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS)](/www/voyager/hardware/uvs/uvs.html)
instruments observed the occultation of the star delta Sco by Saturn's rings.
These experiments resolved the rings down to a scale of 100 meters. This
animation shows the viewing geometry during the experiment.
