**Caption: **      This enhanced color image shows the outer half of Saturn's main ring system. The dark Cassini Division near the middle divides the outer A Ring from the B Ring. The Cassini Division was once thought to be empty, but this view shows that it contains several fainter ring structures. The most prominent structure in the A Ring is the Encke Gap, about 1/3 way from the ring's outer edge. This gap is ["shepherded"](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#shepherding_satellite). open by the tiny embedded moon Pan. The B Ring is more densely packed with material than the A Ring (i.e., higher in [optical depth](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#optical_depth)) so it shows up as brighter in this image at a low [phase angle](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#phase_angle). Several faint "spokes" are visible as dark streaks across the B Ring. Much better images of the B Ring's spokes were acquired by [Voyager 2](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/voyager/voyager2.html) about nine months later. At lower right, you can see the outer tip of the much fainter C Ring.
