Voyager 2 returned this high-resolution view of Saturn's rings Aug. 23 at a
range of 3.3 million kilometers (2 million miles). The planet's limb is
visible through the C ring and the inner part of the B ring. The ring shadows
have been obscured by the bright band of light, evident on Saturn's surface,
that passed through the more transparent Cassini Division. The Cassini
Division is the darker gap that extends from the lower center of this image to
the upper left; it is about 5,000 km. (3,100 mi.) wide. Many bright and dark
ringlets are seen throughout the complex ring system. The Voyager project is
managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
