Cassini spacecraft spots a couple of large, wedge-shaped spokes in Saturn's B
ring.

pokes are similar in appearance to those seen by the Voyager spacecraft (see
[PIA02275](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02275)).

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) can be spotted interior to the
narrow F ring at left. Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across at its widest
point) is barely visible within the Encke Gap, below center.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 26 degrees
below the ringplane. Pan has been brightened in this image for better
visibility. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on July 8, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 749,000 kilometers (465,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 31 degrees. Image scale is 41 kilometers
(26 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
