Enceladus hangs like a single bright pearl against the golden-brown canvas of
Saturn and its icy rings. Visible on Saturn is the region where daylight gives
way to dusk. Above, the rings throw thin shadows onto the planet.

Icy Enceladus is 505 kilometers (314 miles) across.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were taken using the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 17, 2006 at a distance of approximately
200,000 kilometers (100,000 miles) from Enceladus. The image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
