The moon Janus casts a shadow on Saturn's A ring but misses the thin F ring in
this image captured as the planet approached its August 2009 equinox.

The moon itself is not pictured, and the shadow has missed the thin F ring
because the moon has inclined orbit. See
[PIA11543](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11543) for a similar
image of Pandora's shadow. Janus' shadow here reaches past the Encke Gap of
the A ring. The Cassini Division runs from the middle right to the top left of
the image. The image has been cropped and zoomed-in by a factor of two.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 52 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on May 28, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 53 degrees. Image scale is 77 kilometers
(48 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
