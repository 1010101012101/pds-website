The shadow of Saturn's moon Dione, cast onto the planet, is elongated in
dramatic fashion.

The moon itself does not appear here, but the shadow can be seen south of the
ringplane. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from
just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 14,
2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.4 million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 118 degrees. Image scale is 140
kilometers (87 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
