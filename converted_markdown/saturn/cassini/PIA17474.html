A swing high above Saturn by NASA's Cassini spacecraft revealed this stately
view of the golden-hued planet and its main rings. The view is in natural
color, as human eyes would have seen it. This mosaic was made from 36 images
in three color filters obtained by Cassini's imaging science subsystem on Oct.
10, 2013. The observation and resulting image mosaic were planned as one of
three images for Cassini's 2013 Scientist for a Day essay contest.

Saturn sports differently colored bands of weather in this image. For
instance, a bright, narrow wave of clouds around 42 degrees north latitude
appears to be some of the turbulent aftermath of a giant storm that reached
its violent peak in early 2011. The mysterious six-sided weather pattern known
as the hexagon is visible around Saturn's north pole.

When Cassini arrived in 2004, more of the northern hemisphere sported a bluish
hue and it was northern winter. The golden tones dominated the southern
hemisphere, where it was southern summer. But as the seasons have turned and
northern spring is in full swing, the colors have begun to change in each
hemisphere as well. Golden tones have started to dominate in the northern
hemisphere and the bluish color in the north is now confined to a tighter
circle around the north pole. The southern hemisphere has started getting
bluer, too.

The rings shown here include Saturn's main rings. The rings known as the C, B
and A rings -- listed here in order of closeness to Saturn -- are easily seen.
The F ring is also there, but not easily seen without enhancing the contrast
of the image. (Rings were named in order of their discovery rather than their
position around Saturn.) The rings also cast a shadow on Saturn at the limb of
the planet in the lower right quadrant.

Cassini is currently in a set of tilted orbits known as "inclined orbits" that
allow it to swing up over the north pole and below the south pole. Much of
Cassini's time is spent close to the equatorial plane, where most of Saturn's
rings and moons are located.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team consists of scientists from the United
States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. The imaging operations center
is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
