Saturn's narrow F ring partly obscures the small moon Epimetheus. Interior to
the F ring is the bright A ring.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across at its widest point) is on the
side of the rings opposite from Cassini.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 2 degrees below
the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 11, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (766,000 miles) from Epimetheus. Image
scale is 7 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
