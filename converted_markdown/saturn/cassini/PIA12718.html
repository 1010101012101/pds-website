Four of Saturn's moons join the planet for a well balanced portrait.

Saturn's largest moon, Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across), is in
the lower left. Tethys (1,062 kilometers, or 660 miles across) is in the upper
right. Although those moons appear to be above and below the rings from this
vantage point, the moons actually orbit nearly within the ringplane.

The smaller moons Pandora and Epimetheus are barely visible here. Pandora (81
kilometers, or 50 miles across) appears as a tiny speck on the extreme left,
near the rings. Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) can be
detected above the rings near the middle left of the image. To enhance
visibility, Pandora and Epimetheus have been brightened by a factor of two
relative to the planet, rings, Titan and Tethys.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 3 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 17,
2010 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 728 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 104 degrees. Image scale is 147
kilometers (91 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
