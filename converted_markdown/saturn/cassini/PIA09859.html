Shadows cast by Saturn's rings separate the planet's bright equatorial band
from the darker northern latitudes.

This view makes use of a spectral filter sensitive to absorption of certain
wavelengths of light by methane in Saturn's atmosphere. In the north, the
light at these wavelengths reaches slightly greater depth before being
reflected off the cloud tops, compared to the equatorial region -- and it
passes through more light-absorbing methane along the way.

The innermost rings arc across the lower left corner.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 37
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Feb. 18, 2008 using a spectral filter sensitive to
wavelengths of infrared light centered at 890 nanometers.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
