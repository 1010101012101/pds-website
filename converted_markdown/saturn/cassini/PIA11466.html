A bright narrow ring dominates this view of the Cassini Division separating
Saturn's A and B rings.

The brightest ringlet in this image has been spotted by Cassini before, and is
known to be eccentric. And to the right of the division, an incomplete arc of
bright material scores the edge of the outer B ring, a region markedly
disturbed and shaped by the action of a strong gravitational resonance with
the moon Mimas. Cassini scientists are presently investigating the shape and
behavior of outer B ring, including the feature seen here, to understand how
rings respond to strong external perturbations.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 3 degrees below
the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 25, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 822,000 kilometers (511,000 miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 154 degrees. Image scale is 5
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
