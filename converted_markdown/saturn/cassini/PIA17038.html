Annotated Version

These images show views of Earth and the moon from NASA's Cassini (left) and
MESSENGER spacecraft (right) from July 19, 2013.

In the Cassini image, the wide-angle camera has captured Saturn's rings and
our planet Earth and its moon in the same frame. Earth, which is 898 million
miles (1.44 billion kilometers) away in this image, appears as a blue dot at
center right; the moon can be seen as a fainter protrusion off its right side.
An arrow indicates their location in the annotated version. (More information
about this image can be found at
[PIA17171](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17171)). The other
bright dots nearby are stars.

In the MESSENGER image, Earth and the moon appear as a pair of bright star-
like features. MESSENGER was at a distance of 61 million miles (98 million
kilometers) from Earth when it took this image with the wide-angle camera of
the Mercury Dual Imaging System.

MESSENGER took this image as part of a campaign to search for natural
satellites of Mercury. Earth and the moon appear very large in this picture
because they are overexposed. When looking for potentially dim satellites,
long exposures are required to capture as much light as possible.
Consequently, bright objects in the field of view become saturated and appear
artificially large. In fact, Earth and the moon are each less than a pixel in
size, and no details on either can be seen.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Cassini orbiter and its two
onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. MESSENGER was
designed and built by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory
(APL) in Laurel, Md. The mission is part of NASA's Discovery Program, managed
for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington by the agency's Marshall
Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. JPL and APL manage their respective
missions for SMD.
