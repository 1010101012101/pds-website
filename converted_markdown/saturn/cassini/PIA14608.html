Saturn's moons Daphnis and Pan demonstrate their effects on the planet's rings
in this view from the Cassini spacecraft.

Daphnis (5 miles, or 8 kilometers across), on the left of the image, orbits in
the Keeler Gap of the A ring. The moon's gravitational pull perturbs the
orbits of the particles of the A ring forming the gap's edge and sculpts the
edge into waves that move both in the ring's plane (radially) and out of the
ring's plane. See
[PIA11655](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11655) and
[PIA12698](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12698) to learn more.

Pan (17 miles, or 28 kilometers across), in the top right of the image, orbits
in the Encke Gap of the A ring. The effects of that moon's gravity can be seen
as dark wakes on the parts of the rings below Pan in the image, propagating
towards the middle of the image.. See
[PIA07528](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07528) and
[PIA10529](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10529) to learn more.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 6 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 3, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
329,000 miles (529,000 kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 2 miles (3
kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
