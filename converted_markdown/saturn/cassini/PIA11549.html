As Saturn's equinox continues to approach, the moon Pan casts a slightly
longer shadow on the A ring.

See [PIA11652](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11652) to see an
earlier image of a shorter shadow cast by Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles
across). The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its
August 2009 equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's
equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible
only during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs
only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and
to see movies of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

Three stars are visible through the rings.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 28, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) from Pan
and at a Sun-Pan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 80 degrees. Image scale is 8
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
