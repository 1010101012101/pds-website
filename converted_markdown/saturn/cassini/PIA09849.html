The Cassini spacecraft spots the irregularly shaped icy moon Janus as it
swings around Saturn.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane. Janus is 181 kilometers (113 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 19, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (994,000 miles) from Janus and at a Sun-Janus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 18 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
