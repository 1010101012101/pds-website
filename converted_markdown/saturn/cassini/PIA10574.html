The Encke Gap moon, Pan, has left its mark on a scalloped ringlet of the Encke
Gap. The moon creates these perturbations as it sweeps through the
325-kilometer (200-mile) gap in the A ring.

Three diffuse ringlets reside in the Encke Gap: the bright one on the left of
the gap, a faint one in the middle and a very faint one on the right side of
the gap where the A ring begins again.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 17
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in green light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 10, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (680,000 miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 28 degrees. Image
scale is 7 kilometers (about 4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
