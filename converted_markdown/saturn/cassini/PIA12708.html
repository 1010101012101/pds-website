The shadows of Saturn's rings cast onto the planet appear as a thin band at
the equator in this image taken as the planet approached its August 2009
equinox.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and to cast shadows across the
rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after
Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and
after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows
of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)). For an earlier
view of the rings' wide shadows draped high on the northern hemisphere, see
[PIA09793](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09793).

The planet's southern hemisphere can be seen through the transparent D ring in
the lower right of the image. The rings have been brightened by a factor of
9.5 relative to the planet to enhance visibility.

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 30 degrees above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 18, 2009 at a distance of approximately
2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 122
kilometers (76 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
