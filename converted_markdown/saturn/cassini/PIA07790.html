These figures show four propeller-shaped structures discovered by the Cassini
spacecraft in close-up images of Saturn's A ring.

The propellers are about 5 kilometers (3 miles) long from tip to tip, and the
radial offset (the "leading" dash is slightly closer to Saturn) is about 300
meters (1,000 feet). See
[PIA07791](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07791) and
[PIA07792](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07792) for additional
images and information about these features.

The figures were cropped from two original Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera images and magnified for visibility. The images were then re-projected
so that orbital motion is to the left and Saturn is up. The unseen moonlets
lie in the center of each structure. The figures were cropped from two
original Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera images, taken during Saturn
orbit insertion on July 1, 2004, and magnified for visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
