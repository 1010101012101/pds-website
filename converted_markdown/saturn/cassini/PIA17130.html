Saturn's A ring is decorated with several kinds of waves. Here the Cassini
spacecraft has captured a host of density waves, a bending wave (in the upper-
right corner), and the edge waves on the edge of the Keeler gap caused by the
small moon Daphnis. Daphnis itself appears as a tiny dot in the middle of the
Keeler gap.

See [PIA10501](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10501) for a closer
look at bending and density waves and to learn more about them. For more on
the edge waves caused by Daphnis, see
[PIA11655](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11655).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 41
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 28, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 777,000 miles (1.3
million kilometers) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 76 degrees. Image scale is 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
