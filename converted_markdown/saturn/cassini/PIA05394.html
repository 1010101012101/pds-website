Saturn's rings cast threadlike shadows on the planet's northern hemisphere.
Note the translucent C ring, and thin outermost F ring. The image was taken
with the Cassini narrow angle camera in visible light on May 10, 2004, at a
distance of 27.2 million kilometers (16.9 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles) per pixel. Contrast in the image was
enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
