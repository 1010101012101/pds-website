The shadow of Saturn cuts across the rings in this recent Cassini spacecraft
image. As the ring particles enter Saturn's shadow, their temperature drops to
even colder temperatures, only to warm back up again when they re-emerge into
the sunlight. Ring scientists think that these temperature swings may help
change the physical properties of the ring particles.

Eight stars are visible in this image, including one through the rings.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 56
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible violet light with
the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 29, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 639,000 miles (1.0
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 128 degrees. Image scale is 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
