Saturn's enchanting rings display crisply defined edges and strong contrast on
their unilluminated side.

Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) sits on the far side of the rings
above center, between the A and F rings. This view was acquired from about 1
degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 21, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.4 million kilometers
(1.5 million miles) from Atlas. Image scale is 14 kilometers (9 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
