In this rare image taken on July 19, 2013, the wide-angle camera on NASA's
Cassini spacecraft has captured Saturn's rings and our planet Earth and its
moon in the same frame. It is only one footprint in a mosaic of 33 footprints
covering the entire Saturn ring system (including Saturn itself). At each
footprint, images were taken in different spectral filters for a total of 323
images: some were taken for scientific purposes and some to produce a natural
color mosaic. This is the only wide-angle footprint that has the Earth-moon
system in it.

The dark side of Saturn, its bright limb, the main rings, the F ring, and the
G and E rings are clearly seen; the limb of Saturn and the F ring are
overexposed. The "breaks" in the brightness of Saturn's limb are due to the
shadows of the rings on the globe of Saturn, preventing sunlight from shining
through the atmosphere in those regions. The E and G rings have been
brightened for better visibility.

Earth, which is 898 million miles (1.44 billion kilometers) away in this
image, appears as a blue dot at center right; the moon can be seen as a
fainter protrusion off its right side. An arrow indicates their location in
the annotated version. (The two are clearly seen as separate objects in the
accompanying composite image
[PIA14949](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14949).) The other
bright dots nearby are stars.

This is only the third time ever that Earth has been imaged from the outer
solar system. The acquisition of this image, along with the accompanying
composite narrow- and wide-angle image of Earth and the moon and the full
mosaic from which both are taken, marked the first time that inhabitants of
Earth knew in advance that their planet was being imaged. That opportunity
allowed people around the world to join together in social events to celebrate
the occasion.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 20
degrees below the ring plane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 19, 2013 at a distance of approximately
753,000 miles (1.212 million kilometers) from Saturn, and approximately
898.414 million miles (1.445858 billion kilometers) from Earth. Image scale on
Saturn is 43 miles (69 kilometers) per pixel; image scale on the Earth is
53,820 miles (86,620 kilometers) per pixel. The illuminated areas of neither
Earth nor the Moon are resolved here. Consequently, the size of each "dot" is
the same size that a point of light of comparable brightness would have in the
wide-angle camera.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
