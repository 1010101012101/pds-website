Earth's jet stream is a subject of intense interest and concern thanks to its
effects on our weather. Saturn's polar jet stream, seen here, causes no such
worries for Earthlings, so we can simply marvel at its graceful form.

This atmospheric feature was first observed by Voyager and was dubbed 'the
hexagon'. To see more of this feature, see
[PIA10486](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10486) and
[PIA11682](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11682).

This view looks toward the north pole of Saturn from about 53 degrees above
the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on July 23, 2013 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 590,000 miles (949,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 52
degrees. Image scale is 35 miles (57 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
