Dramatic edge-on Cassini views of Saturn's E ring, like these side-by-side
images, reveal for the first time a double-banded structure. The structure is
similar to that of Jupiter's gossamer ring and to the bands of dust found
within the solar system's asteroid belt. Scientists believe that the E ring
particles have their origins in the geysers erupting from the south polar of
Enceladus.

The double-banded appearance exists because there are fewer particles close to
the ring plane than 500 to 1,000 kilometers (300 to 600 miles) above and
below. This circumstance can arise if the particles making up the ring
encircle Saturn on inclined orbits with a very restricted range of
inclinations.

This special condition might exist for two reasons. One possibility is that
the particles being jetted out of Enceladus and injected into Saturn orbit may
begin their journey around Saturn with a certain velocity, and consequently a
restricted range of inclinations, with respect to the ring plane. Another is
that the particles may begin with a large range of inclinations, but those
orbiting very close to the ring plane get gravitationally scattered and
removed from that region by the passage of Enceladus.

Scientists will continue to observe the E ring from various angles to confirm
and understand the structure.

Most of the bright specks in the images are background stars, although a few
are cosmic ray hits on the camera's detector.

The two images were taken five hours apart on Dec. 1, 2005, when Cassini was
approximately 1.9 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. The
image scale on the sky at the distance of Saturn is about 220 kilometers (137
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
