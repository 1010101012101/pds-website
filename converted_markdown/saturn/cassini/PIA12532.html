The cratered moon Mimas appears as if it has been hung like an ornament above
Saturn's rings in this Cassini spacecraft image.

The spacecraft was closer to Mimas than to the rings when this image was
taken. Lit terrain seen here is on the trailing hemisphere of Mimas (396
kilometers, or 246 miles across). This view looks toward the northern, sunlit
side of the rings from just above the ringplane. Saturn's shadow obscures part
of the rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 3, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
760,000 kilometers (472,000 miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 61 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
