The serene beauty of Saturn invites the Cassini spacecraft's gaze as the
spacecraft hurtles through this dynamic system, studying the giant planet's
rings, moons, atmosphere, and magnetosphere.

The icy moon Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles across) is on the planet's
near side, about 180,000 kilometers (112,000 miles) closer to Cassini than
Saturn, in this scene.

The view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from less than a degree
below the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters
were combined to create this natural color view. The images were obtained with
the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 22, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 927,000 kilometers (576,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is
56 kilometers (35 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
