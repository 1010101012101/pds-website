The Encke Gap, the broad, vertical dark band running down the center of this
image, is maintained by the small moon Pan (not pictured). Pan also shepherds
three ringlets, all of which appear here as faint, narrow bands within the
Encke Gap.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 19, 2008 at a distance of approximately 271,000 kilometers
(168,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
138 degrees. Image scale is about 1 kilometer per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
