Saturn's whirling vortices and feathery cloud bands are the signs of a
restless world. Cassini captured this arresting view of the giant planet
scored by bold shadows cast by the rings. The rings are seen edge-on in this
dramatic, artfully tilted scene.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 6,
2005, at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1 million miles)
from Saturn through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 750 nanometers. The image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
