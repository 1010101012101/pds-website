Five wide bands near the center of this image form the structure of the
Cassini Division--an expanse between Saturn's B and A rings that appears dark
or black in many other images.

The 4,800-kilometer wide (2,980-mile wide) division spans the right side of
the image along with a small part of the B ring. The inner part of the A ring
appears on the left.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 9 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
819,000 kilometers (509,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 154 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
