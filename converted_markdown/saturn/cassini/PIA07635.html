Rhea floats below the innermost regions of Saturn's amazing rings. This view
of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles
across) allows a glimpse of the wispy terrain that covers the trailing
hemisphere of Rhea.

(See [PIA06575](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06575)) &
[PIA06578](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06578)) for similar
views of the wispy terrain.)

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini narrow-angle camera on
Oct. 9, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers (1.2
million miles) from Rhea and at a Sun-Rhea-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 51
degrees. The image scale is 12 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
