Saturn's small, irregularly-shaped moon Epimetheus orbits against the backdrop
of the planet's rings, which are nearly edge-on in this view. Some of the
moon's larger geological features can be seen here. Epimetheus is 116
kilometers (72 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 990,000 kilometers
(615,000 miles) from Epimetheus and at a Sun-Epimetheus-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 99 degrees. Resolution in the original image was 6 kilometers (4
miles) per pixel. The image has been contrast-enhanced and magnified by a
factor of two to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
