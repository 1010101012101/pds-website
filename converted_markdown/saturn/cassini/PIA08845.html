The striated appearance of the F ring is immediately apparent in the region of
the ring that trails behind the moon Prometheus. The F ring is characterized
here by dark gores that stretch inward toward the planet and forward in the
direction of motion.

This image has been expanded in the horizontal direction by a factor of five
in order to make radial variations more prominent. The curvature of the rings
is also exaggerated by the horizontal stretch.

The exterior flanking ringlets (to the right of the bright ring core) are not
disturbed by Prometheus to the great degree seen in the inner ringlets.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 31 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 25, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 162 degrees. Scale in the original image is 10 kilometers (6 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
