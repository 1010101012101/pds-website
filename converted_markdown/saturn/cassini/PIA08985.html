The effects of three of Saturn's ring moons can be spotted in this single
narrow-angle camera view.

The image has been strongly enhanced to better show the wakes on both sides of
the Encke Gap caused by Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across, left of
center), as well as a hint of the edge waves in the narrow Keeler Gap caused
by Daphnis (7 kilometers, 4.3 miles across, below center).

Bright Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across, at right) pulls away
from its latest close encounter with the F ring. The aftereffects of its
recent passes are visible in the ring's inner edge.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 10
degrees above the ringplane. Saturn's shadow cuts across the rings at the top
of the scene.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 5, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.3 million kilometers
(1.4 million miles) from Pan. Image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
