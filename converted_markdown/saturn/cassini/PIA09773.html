Saturn looks on as three moons round the rings.

From farthest to nearest the Cassini spacecraft: Tethys (1071 kilometers, or
665 miles across) is seen above the rings. Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles
across) lies immediately outside the edge of the narrow F ring. Mimas (397
kilometers, or 247 miles across) floats beneath the rings' edge.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 2
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Oct. 6, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.4 million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 141 kilometers (88 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
