Our robotic explorer Cassini regards the shadow-draped face of Saturn.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 14
degrees above the ringplane. In this viewing geometry all of the main rings,
except for the B ring, appear transparent. The rings cast their mirror image
onto the planet beyond.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 9, 2007, at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (972,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 90
kilometers (56 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
