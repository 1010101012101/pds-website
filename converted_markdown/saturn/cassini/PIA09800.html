A section of Saturn's perturbed F ring displays kinks in its bright, double-
stranded core. At left, edge waves in the Encke Gap, caused by the presence of
Pan, can be seen, along with two faint ringlets.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 4
degrees above the ringplane. The rings disappear into the planet's shadow at
the top of the scene.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 14, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-ring-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of about 55 degrees.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
