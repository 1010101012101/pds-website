Saturn's shadow spreads across the rings here, extending beyond the F ring and
its tenuous, flanking ringlets. This view catches Saturn's moon Mimas on its
day-long sojourn around the planet. Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles)
across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 24, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers
(1.3 million miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 84 degrees. The image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
