Below a darkened Enceladus, a plume of water ice is backlit in this view of
one of Saturn's most dramatic moons.

See [PIA11688](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11688) and
[PIA08386](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08386) to learn more
about the jets of water ice emanating from the south polar region of
Enceladus. Lit terrain seen here is on the leading hemisphere of Enceladus
(313 miles, or 504 kilometers across). North is up.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 20, 2012. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
83,000 miles (134,000 kilometers) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 165 degrees. Image scale is 2,628 feet (801
meters) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
