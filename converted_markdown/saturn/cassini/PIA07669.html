In this magnificent view, delicate haze layers high in the atmosphere encircle
the oblate figure of Saturn. A special combination of spectral filters used
for this image makes the high haze become visible. A methane-sensitive filter
(centered at 889 nanometers) makes high altitude features stand out, while a
polarizing filter makes small haze particles appear bright.

Methane in the atmosphere absorbs light with wavelengths around 889 nanometers
as it travels deeper into the gas planet, thus bright areas in this image must
represent reflective material at higher altitudes. Small particles or
individual molecules scatter light quite effectively to a polarization of 90
degrees, which this polarizing filter is sensitive to. Thus, high altitude
haze layers appear bright in this view.

The small blob of light at far right is Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles
across).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 5,
2005, at a distance of approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 100
degrees. The image scale is 169 kilometers (105 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
