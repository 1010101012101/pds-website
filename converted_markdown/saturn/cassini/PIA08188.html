Saturn's largest moon, Titan, peaks out from under the planet's rings of ice.

This view looks toward Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across) from
slightly beneath the ringplane. The dark Encke gap (325 kilometers, or 200
miles wide) is visible here, as is the narrow F ring.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were taken with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 28, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Titan. Image
scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel on Titan.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
