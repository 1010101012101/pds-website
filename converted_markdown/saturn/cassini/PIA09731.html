The two moons pictured here each share their orbits with other bodies.

Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across, at left) has two much smaller
"Trojan" moons, Helene and Polydeuces (not seen here), that orbit 60 degrees
in front of and behind it in its orbit. Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72
miles across, at right) shares its orbital path with Janus, and the two moons
swap positions every few years -- one moving just a bit closer to Saturn and
the other moving slightly farther away.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a
degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 28, 2007. Cassini was approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8
million miles) from Saturn when it acquired this view. Image scale is 15
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on Dione.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
