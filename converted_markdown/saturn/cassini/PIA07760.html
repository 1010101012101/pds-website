A fine spray of small, icy particles emanating from the warm, geologically
unique province surrounding the south pole of Saturn's moon Enceladus was
observed in a Cassini narrow-angle camera image of the crescent moon taken on
Jan. 16, 2005.

Taken from a high phase angle of 148 degrees - a viewing geometry in which
small particles become much easier to see - the plume of material becomes more
apparent in images processed to enhance faint signals.

Imaging scientists have measured the light scattered by the plume's particles
to determine their abundance and fall-off with height. Though the measurements
of particle abundance are more certain within 100 kilometers (60 miles) of the
surface, the values measured there are roughly consistent with the abundance
of water ice particles made by other Cassini instruments (reported in
September 2005) at altitudes as high as 400 kilometers (250 miles) above the
surface.

At present, it is not clear if the plume particles emanating from the south
pole arises because of water vapor escaping from warm ice that is exposed to
the surface. Another possibility is that at some depth beneath the surface,
the temperatures are hot enough for water to become liquid, which then, under
pressure, escapes to the surface like a cold Yellowstone geyser.

The image at the left was taken in visible green light. A dark mask was
applied to the moon's bright limb to make the plume feature easier to see.

The image at the right has been color-coded to make faint signals in the plume
more apparent. Images of other moons, such as Tethys and Mimas, taken in the
last 10 months from similar lighting and viewing geometries, and with
identical camera parameters, were closely examined to demonstrate that the
plume towering above Enceladus' south pole is real and not a camera artifact.

The images were acquired at a distance of about 209,400 kilometers (130,100
miles) from Enceladus. Image scale is about 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
