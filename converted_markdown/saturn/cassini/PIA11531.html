The moon Prometheus and a bit of Saturn's northern hemisphere are both
brilliantly lit by the sun here, making the A ring seem dim in comparison.

The bright limb of Saturn's northern hemisphere can be seen through the A ring
in the lower left of the image. Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across)
orbits in the Roche Division between Saturn's A and F ring.

For a similar view of Pandora, another of the F ring's shepherding moons, see
[PIA09899](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09899).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 20 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in red light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 25, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 694,000 kilometers (431,000 miles) from Prometheus
and at a Sun-prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 49 degrees. Image scale
is 3.6 kilometers (2.2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
