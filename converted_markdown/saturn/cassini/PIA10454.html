Saturn's rings burst out of shadow and curve gracefully around the planet.
Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across at its widest point) appears as
a bright speck touching the inside of the narrow F ring. Atlas (30 kilometers,
19 miles across at its widest point) is also visible, faintly, upward and to
the left of Prometheus, just outside the A ring edge.

Saturn's shadow cuts across the rings at top right.

Several dark, narrow spokes are faintly visible near the B-ring ansa, left of
center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 13
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were
obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 4, 2008 at a
distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (775,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 71 kilometers (44 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
