The shadow of the moon Mimas has just slipped off Saturn's rings and onto the
planet in this Cassini spacecraft image.

The shadow is visible as a short dash below the rings' shadows on the planet.
At this exposure setting, the rings are too dim to be seen easily. As Saturn
approaches its August 2009 equinox, the planet's moons cast shadows onto the
rings. To learn more about this special time and to see a movie of a moon's
shadow moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 61
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were
obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 30, 2009 at a
distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 80 kilometers (50 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
