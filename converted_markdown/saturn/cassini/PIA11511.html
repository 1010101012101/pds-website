Saturn's moon Pan casts a delicate shadow onto the planet's A ring.

Shown in the center of this image, Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across)
orbits within the Encke Gap of the A ring. Other bright specks in the image
are background stars. As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox, the
planet's moons cast shadows onto the rings. To learn more about this special
time and to see a movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 2, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) from Pan
and at a Sun-Pan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 108 degrees. Image scale is 9
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
