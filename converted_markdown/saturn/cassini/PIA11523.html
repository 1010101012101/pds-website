The shadow of the moon Tethys is revealed on Saturn's B and C rings in this
image which also includes the planet.

The planet is overexposed in this image in which the exposure time was set to
capture the faint shadow on the rings. Tethys itself is not visible in this
image. As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox, the planet's moons cast
shadows onto the rings. To learn more about this special time and to see a
movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 20
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on May 12, 2009. The view was obtained at
a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 28 degrees. Image scale is
65 kilometers (40 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
