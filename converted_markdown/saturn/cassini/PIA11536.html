Seen from the unlit side of Saturn's A ring, the shadow of the moon Janus is
cast across the Encke Gap.

The varying darkness of the shadow is due to varying particle density across
the ring. To learn more and to watch a movie of a moon's shadow moving across
the unlit side of the rings, see
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 2009
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see a movie
of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

Janus is not shown in this image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 28, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 54 degrees. Image
scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.
