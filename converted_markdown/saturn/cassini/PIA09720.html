Two moons on opposite sides of the rings slide past each other in this stately
portrait of Saturn.

Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across), on the far side of Saturn,
appears above the rings. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) poses
directly in front of the ringplane.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a
degree above the ringplane. The silhouette of the rings overlay the subtle
texture of Saturn's atmosphere.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on July 29, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 3.2 million kilometers (2 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 32 degrees. Image scale is 188
kilometers (117 miles) per pixel.
