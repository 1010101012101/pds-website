Cassini was nearly in the plane of Saturn's rings when it took this image of
Janus. The nearly edge-on rings appear almost ribbon-like in this view, and
some surface detail is visible on the small moon. Janus is 181 kilometers (113
miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 911,000 kilometers
(566,000 miles) from Janus and at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
101 degrees. The image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
