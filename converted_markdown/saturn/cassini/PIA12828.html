The head of Saturn's huge northern storm is well established in this view
captured early in the storm's development by NASA's Cassini spacecraft in late
2010.

Saturn's atmosphere and its rings are shown here in a false-color composite
made from three images taken in near-infrared light through filters that are
sensitive to varying degrees of methane absorption. Red and orange colors in
this view indicate clouds that are deep in the atmosphere. Yellow and green
colors, most noticeable near the top of the view, indicate intermediate
clouds. White and blue indicate high clouds and haze. The rings appear as a
thin horizontal line of bright blue because they are outside of the atmosphere
and not affected by methane absorption.

For a nearly true-color version of this view, see
[PIA12824](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12824).

See PIA14905 to learn more about this storm and watch its development over
several months. Earlier in the Cassini mission, the spacecraft chronicled a
smaller storm in the southern hemisphere called the "Dragon Storm." See
[PIA06197](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06197) to learn more
about that storm and to see a similar, false-color view.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from just
below the ring plane.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a
combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light. The image filtered at 890 nanometers is projected as blue. The image
filtered at 728 nanometers is projected as green, and the image filtered at
752 nanometers is projected as red.

The images were taken on Dec. 24, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million miles (1.9 million kilometers) from Saturn and at a
sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 71 degrees. Image scale is about 89
miles (143 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
