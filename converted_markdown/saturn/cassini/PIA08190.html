The dark shadows that drape Saturn's northern latitudes are split by three
familiar bright gaps. From bottom to top, sunlight passes through the broad
Cassini Division (4,800 kilometers, or 2,980 miles wide), the Encke gap (325
kilometers, or 200 miles wide) and (barely visible) the Keeler gap (42
kilometers, or 26 miles wide).

It is unlikely that the shadows cast by Saturn's rings have much of an effect
on the large-scale movements of the atmosphere. The dynamic clouds of this gas
giant are driven by processes going on much deeper inside the planet, where
sunlight does not penetrate.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The image was acquired with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 28, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 377,000 kilometers (234,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is
19 kilometers (12 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
