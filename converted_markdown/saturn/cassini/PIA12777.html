The Cassini spacecraft looks toward Saturn's tiny moon Aegaeon within the
G-ring arc.

The moonlet Aegaeon (formerly known as S/2008 S 1) can't be seen in this
image, but it orbits in the bright arc of Saturn's faint G ring shown here.
See [PIA11148](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11148) to learn
more.

Many background stars are visibly elongated by the motion of the spacecraft
during the image's exposure. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side
of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 4, 2011. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 14
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
