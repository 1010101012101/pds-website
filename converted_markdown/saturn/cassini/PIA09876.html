Saturn dominates this colorful view, taken from a vantage point high above the
rings. From here the Cassini spacecraft can see the rings' far side, where the
dark shadow of Saturn abruptly terminates their visibility.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) casts its shadow onto the planet's
northern latitudes below center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 27
degrees above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 26, 2008 at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 93
kilometers (58 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
