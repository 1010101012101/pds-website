The bright arc within Saturn's G ring is shown truncated by the shadow of the
planet at the bottom of this image.

Although it can't be seen here, the tiny moonlet Aegaeon (formerly known as
S/2008 S 1) orbits within the bright arc. See
[PIA11148](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11148) to learn more.
This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 4
degrees above the ringplane. Many background stars are visible elongated by
the motion of the spacecraft during the image's exposure.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 9, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 12
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
