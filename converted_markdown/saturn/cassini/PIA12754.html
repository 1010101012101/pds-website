Saturn's rings appear as only a thin line seen edge-on in the middle of this
Cassini view, but the rings cast broad shadows on the southern hemisphere of
the planet in the lower left of the image.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from just
below the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 9,
2011 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 728 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 796,000 kilometers (494,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 147 degrees. Image scale is 44
kilometers (27 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
