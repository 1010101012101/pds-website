The Cassini spacecraft looks down from a high-inclination orbit to spot two of
Saturn's ring moons.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across at its widest point) leads a
train of dark gores in the narrow F ring. Farther from Saturn lies Janus (179
kilometers, or 111 miles across at its widest point), which sits in its own
faint ring--invisible here but clearly seen in
[PIA08328](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08328).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 62
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 19, 2008. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 740,000 kilometers (460,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 41 kilometers (25 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
