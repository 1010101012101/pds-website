Saturn's brightly lit rings slice across this Cassini spacecraft picture taken
before a backdrop of the planet's clouds.

The shadow of the rings can be seen cast upon the planet in the lower right of
the image. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from
just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April
11, 2010 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 938 nanometers.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers
(1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 77 degrees. Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
