Prometheus poses here with its latest creation: a dark, diagonal gore in the
tenuous material interior to Saturn's F ring. The shepherd moon creates a new
gore each time it comes closest to the F ring in its orbit of Saturn, and the
memory of previous passes is preserved in the rings's structure for some time
afterward. Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 20, 2005, at a distance of approximately 499,000 kilometers
(310,000 miles) from Saturn and at a high Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 144 degrees. Resolution in the original image was 3 kilometers (2
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
