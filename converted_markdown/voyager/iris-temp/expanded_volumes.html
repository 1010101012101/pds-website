## Voyager IRIS Expanded Volumes VGIRIS_0001-2

A more complete version of the IRIS data sets from Jupiter and Saturn is ready
for peer review at the Rings Node. It includes all the data from each
encounter, not just that obtained within a few days of closest approach. It
also includes the data in convenient binary and ASCII formats compatible with
all modern computer systems. Comments are welcome.

The volumes are on line for browsing or they can be downloaded as compressed
archives:

  * Jupiter data: [VGIRIS_0001](/volumes/VGIRIS_0001/) ([.tar.gz](/archives/VGIRIS_0001_peer_review.tar.gz)) 
  * Saturn data: [VGIRIS_0002](/volumes/VGIRIS_0002/) ([.zip](/archives/VGIRIS_0002_peer_review.zip)) 

Note that the Uranus and Neptune data sets were obtained in a different
format, and expanded archives are not currently planned.

For more information about these volumes, consult the following documentation:

  * [AAREADME.TXT](expanded_aareadme.txt): Overview of the data set. 
  * CATALOG/[DATASET.CAT](expanded_dataset.txt): Data set description. 

**Note:** This version of the data supercedes the first preliminary draft, entitled VG_2002. That volume contains known errors and is no longer available.
