# 5 Archive Volume Format

This section describes the format of Cassini RPWS Standard Product Archive
Volumes. Data that comprise the RPWS Standard Product Archives will be
formatted in accordance with

Planetary Data System specifications [Planetary Science Data Dictionary, 2002;
PDS Data Preparation Workbook, 1995; PDS Standards Reference, 2002].

## 5.1 Disk Format

All DVD volumes in the Cassini RPWS Standard Product Archive Collection will
conform to the Digital Versatile Disk UDF-ISO Bridge format (with ISO-9660
level 2 compatibility).

## 5.2 File Formats

The following section describes file formats from the kinds of files contained
on archive volumes. For more information, see the PDS Data Preparation
Workbook [1995], [Appendix B.](appB.html#APPB)

### 5.2.1 Document File Format

Document files with the .TXT suffix exist in most directories. They are ASCII
files with embedded PDS labels. All TXT document files consist of variable-
length records (lines), terminated with carriage return (ASCII 13) and line
feed (ASCII 10) character pairs. This is the standard Microsoft text file
format and can be easily accommodated by MacOS, UNIX, and other common
operating systems.

In general, documents are provided in ASCII text format. However, if the
document contained in the DOCUMENT directory contains formatting and figures
that cannot be rendered as ASCII text, then the document is also given in
hypertext format. The hypertext file contains ASCII text plus hypertext markup
language (HTML) commands that enable it to be viewed in a web browser such as
Netscape or Internet Explorer. Hypertext documents may reference ancillary
files such as images that are incorporated into the document by the web
browser. All image files in this archive will be in PNG format. Native formats
for most documents are also provided, such as Corel Wordperfect. Adobe Acrobat
versions of most documents are also provided.

### 5.2.2 Tabular File Format

Tabular files (.TAB extension) exist in the INDEX, RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS, and
ANCILLARY directories. Tabular files are ASCII files formatted for direct
reading into many database management systems on various computers. Fields
normally are separated by commas or whitespace, and character fields are
enclosed in double quotation marks (A). Character fields are padded with
spaces to keep quotation marks in the same columns of successive records.
Character fields are left justified, and numeric fields are right justified.
The Astart byte@ and Abytes@ values listed in the labels do not include the
commas between fields or the quotation marks surrounding character fields. The
records are of fixed length, and the last two bytes of each record contain the
ASCII carriage return and line feed characters. This allows a table to be
treated as a fixed length record file on computers that support this file type
and as a text file with embedded line delimiters on those that don=t.

All tabular files are described by detached PDS label files. A detached PDS
label file has the same name as the data file it describes, with the extension
.LBL; for example, the file INDEX.TAB is accompanied by the detached label
file INDEX.LBL in the same directory.

### 5.2.3 PDS Label Format

All data files in the RPWS Standard Product Archive Collection have PDS labels
[Planetary Science Data Dictionary, 2002; PDS Standards Reference, 2002].
These labels all are detached from the data files (same file name prefix, .LBL
suffix).

A PDS label, whether embedded or detached from its associated file, provides
descriptive information about the associated file. The PDS label is an object-
oriented structure consisting of sets of >keyword = value= declarations. The
object to which the label refers (e.g. IMAGE, TABLE, etc.) is denoted by a
statement of the form:

    
    
              ^object = location

in which the carat character (^, also called a pointer in this context)
indicates where to find the object. In a PDS label, the location denotes the
name of the file containing the object, along with the starting record or byte
number, if there is more than one object in the file. For example:

    
    
              ^HEADER=(A98118.DAT@,1)
              ^TABLE=(A98118.DAT@,1025 <BYTES>)

indicates that the HEADER object begins at record 1 and that the TABLE object
begins at byte 1025 of the file 98118.DAT. The file 98118.DAT must be located
in the same directory as the detached label file.

Below is a list of the possible formats for the ^object definition in labels
in this product.

^object = n  
  
---  
  
^object = n <BYTES>  
  
^object = Afilename.ext@  
  
^object = (Afilename.ext@, n)  
  
^object = (Afilename.ext@, n <BYTES>)  
      
    
    where
    
         n is the starting record or byte number of the object, counting from the beginning of the 
                  file (record 1, byte 1),
                  <BYTES> indicates that the number given is in units of bytes (the default is records),
                  filename is the up-to-27-character, alphanumeric upper-case file name,
                  ext is the up-to-3-character upper-case file extension.

All detached labels are ASCII text files with lines terminated with carriage
return (ASCII 13) and line feed (ASCII 10) character pairs. Some may be padded
out with spaces to form 80-byte fixed-length records. These text formats may
be easily read on all common operating systems.

### 5.2.4 Catalog File Format

Catalog files (suffix .CAT) exist in the Root and Catalog directories. They
are formatted in an object-oriented structure consisting of sets of >keyword =
value= declarations.

### 5.2.5 Index File Format

The Index file format is an ASCII table containing information about the data
products included in this volume and a cumulative list for the collection
including this volume. It includes information such as the Volume ID, Product
ID, start SCET, path relative to the root of the volume, data set ID, and RPWS
receiver which produces the data. A format description file for the Index file
is given in [Appendix G.](appG.html#APPG)

### 5.2.6 Science Data File Formats

#### 5.2.6.1 RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS_BROWSE Data Product Format

These will be PNG formatted images of frequency-time spectrograms of the key
parameters data with one electric and one magnetic spectrogram per day for
which there are data.

#### 5.2.6.2 RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS Data Product Format

This is an ASCII flat file table with a time tag followed by averages in
frequency and time for both electric and magnetic field spectral densities.
There are 70 (TBD) electric and 40 (TBD) magnetic channels and the time
resolution is 1-minutes. These characteristics are not definite until the MAPS
working group have concluded their discussion of the MAPS key parameters. The
table will consist of a time (SCET) column followed by ~ 70 electric field
spectral density values and ~40 magnetic field spectral densities. The record
header will define the center frequencies of these channels. The time will
refer to the beginning time of the averaging interval. A more detailed file
format is given in [Appendix B](appB.html#APPB) in the RPWSKEY.FMT file. A
data quality flag is also included. If this flag is 0, then the confidence in
the data included in this record is high. If the flag is 1, then there is some
question about the data in the record, and they should be used with caution.

#### 5.2.6.3 RPWS_RAW_COMPLETE Data Product Format

The Raw Complete data files are variable length binary formatted files with a
complex structure including embedded minipackets segregating telemetry from
the various RPWS receivers into separate substructures. The format is given in
the Software Users Guide included in the DOCUMENT directory.

#### 5.2.6.4 RPWS_LOW_RATE_BROWSE Data Product Format

These will be PNG formatted images of frequency-time spectrograms of the low-
rate survey data with one electric and one magnetic spectrogram per day for
which there are data.

#### 5.2.6.5 RPWS_LOW_RATE_FULL Data Product Format

There will be four different types of files included in this data set as
described in [section 4.6.3.](chap4.html#SEC4.6.3) Each will be a binary table
which has time columns (SCET and SCLK), a sensor column, and an array of
spectral densities. The header in each file will list the center frequencies
of the channels for which spectral densities are given. Each record will
include a complete set of spectral densities for the set of channels
indicated, with the time being the start time of the data acquisition for the
spectral densities. A detailed file format is given in [Appendix
D](appD.html#APPD) embedded in the sample RPWS_LOW_RATE_FULL label file.

#### 5.2.6.6 RPWS_WIDEBAND_BROWSE Data Product Format

These will be PNG formatted images of frequency-time spectrograms of the
wideband data. There will be one image for each contiguous set of WBR
observations in a given frequency range (i.e. 10 kHz, 75 kHz, or specific
frequency selection of HF-WBR data).

#### 5.2.6.7 RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL Data Product Format

This is a binary time series data set. Each record will include time
information (SCET and SCLK, sensor, and gain state (required for calibration)
as well as a time series of waveform measurements. A detailed description of
the file format is in [Appendix E](appE.html#APPE) in RPWSWBRFR.FMT.

#### 5.2.6.8 RPWS_WAVEFORM_BROWSE Data Product Format

These will be PNG formatted images of 5-channel frequency-time spectrograms of
the waveform data. There will be one image including all five channels for
each day as long as there is only one set of channels selected for that day.
For days where the channel selections change, there will be an image for each
selected set of channels. For example, if a particular day has a two-hour
interval of delta-n/n observations from Titan but the rest of the day has the
more typical Ex, Ez, Bx, By, Bz set, then two images will be produced. One
will cover the entire day except for the 2-hour Titan observation and the
other will be a two-hour set of frequency-time spectrograms representing the
delta-n/n observations.

#### 5.2.6.9 RPWS_WAVEFORM_FULL Data Product Format

This is a binary time series data set. Each record will include time
information (SCET and SCLK, sensor, and gain state (required for calibration)
as well as a time series of waveform measurements. A detailed description of
the file format is in [Appendix F](appF.html#APPF) in RPWSWFRFR.FMT.
