# 2 Introduction

## 2.1 Content Overview

The Cassini Radio and Plasma Wave Science (RPWS) instrument is a collection of
sensors and receivers on the Cassini Orbiter that acquire plasma wave, radio
wave, thermal plasma, and dust data that address several of the primary
Cassini objectives for studies of the Saturnian system and certain targets of
opportunity during the cruise to Saturn (including Venus, Earth, Jupiter, and
the solar wind). This software interface specification (SIS) covers only the
required archive data products including CODMAC Level 2 and/or 3 (NASA Level
1A and/or 1B) data sets. The RPWS team anticipates archiving some higher level
products as resources permit; these will be specified in a separate SIS or a
future revision to this one.

The following provide brief summaries of the data sets listed in Table 1:

Key Parameters Browse (RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS_BROWSE) consists of Portable
Network Graphics (PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the Key Parameters
data set and serves as a guide to the spectral information in the Key
Parameters data set.

Key Parameters (RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS) is a data set which contains a summary of
the RPWS spectral information as a function of time with parameters which have
been agreed to between RPWS and other Magnetosphere and Plasma Science (MAPS)
instruments as being suitable for the RPWS contribution to the MAPS Key
Parameter Data Set. This parameter set is in the form of an ASCII flat file
including the amplitude (electric and magnetic field spectral densities) of
waves in 10 logarithmically-spaced frequency bands per decade with 1-minute
temporal resolution and is generated by averaging full resolution measurements
falling within the frequency and time bins.

Raw Complete (RPWS_RAW_COMPLETE) consists of decompressed and edited telemetry
packets including all telemetry data from the RPWS. These data are included in
the archive to preserve the original telemetry data, but are not expected to
be used for any but exceptional circumstances. We expect the Low Rate Browse
and other Standard data products to include all of the RPWS data in a much
more accessible form. As such, the Raw Complete data set will be accompanied
only by minimal PDS labels and with documentation, included, which provides
information on how to read and use this data set. The Low Rate Browse data
serves as a guide to the data included in this data set.

Low Rate Browse (RPWS_LOW_RATE_BROWSE) consists of Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the Low Rate Full Resolution
Calibrated data set.

Low Rate Full Resolution Calibrated (RPWS_LOW_RATE_FULL) is a data set
including all spectral density measurements acquired by the RPWS in units of
electric or magnetic field spectral density.

Wideband Browse (RPWS_WIDEBAND_BROWSE) consists of Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the wideband observations acquired
by the RPWS. Subsets of this data set will include data in the 10- and 80-kHz
wideband receiver data (baseband) and high-frequency wideband receiver data
acquired via frequency translation through the High Frequency Receiver from
frequencies between 125 kHz and 16 MHz.

Wideband Full Resolution Uncalibrated (RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL) data are the full
resolution waveform data from the RPWS Wideband Receiver in uncalibrated form.
This data set will include procedures, code examples, and the necessary
information to derive calibrated electric or magnetic fields from the
uncalibrated data.

Waveform Browse (RPWS_WAVEFORM_BROWSE) data are of Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the 5-Channel Waveform Receiver
observations acquired by the RPWS.

Waveform Full Resolution Uncalibrated (RPWS_WAVEFORM_FULL) data are the full
resolution waveform data from the RPWS Wideband Receiver in uncalibrated form.
This data set will include procedures, code examples, and the necessary
information to derive calibrated electric and magnetic field spectral
densities from the uncalibrated data.

More information on these data sets can be found in the sample data set
information templates in Appendices B - E.

This software interface specification describes the format, content, and
generation of the Cassini RPWS Standard Product Archive Volumes. [Section
3](chap3.html#SEC3) , Archive Volume Generation, describes the procedure for
transferring data products to the archive media. [Section 4](chap4.html#SEC4)
, Archive Volume Contents, describes the structure of the archive volumes and
the contents of each file. [Section 5](chap5.html#SEC5) , Archive Volume
Format, describes the file formats used on the archive volumes. Finally,
[Section 6](chap6.html#SEC6) , Support Staff and Cognizant Persons, lists the
individuals responsible for generating the archive volumes.

## 2.2 Scope
