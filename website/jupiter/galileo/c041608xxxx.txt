Structure in the Gossamer Ring

The gossamer ring is really two overlapping rings.

This image is a mosaic of four Galileo images from the C10 encounter,
C0416088922, C0416088968, C0416089022, and C04160890645.  It provides an 
edge-on view of the gossamer ring at a <A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A> of 179 degrees. This
high <A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A> emphasizes very fine dust.  The image has been enhanced
logarithmically in order to reveal the faintest structures. The full
dynamic range is a factor of 1000, with each step in color (blue to red,
red to yellow, and yellow to black and white) indicating roughly a
ten-fold increase in brightness.  The image has also been stretched 
vertically by a factor of two to better reveal the vertical structure of 
the Jovian ring system.

The main ring and halo are seen at left in black and white.  Shown in
yellow is the Amalthea ring, named because it is precisely bounded by
the orbit of the moon Amalthea.  It appears to be composed of dust
raised up off Amalthea and spiralling inward.  Shown in red is a
thicker, fainter ring of dust spiralling inward from a smaller moon,
Thebe.  The faint blue extension to the Thebe ring is unexplained.  The
thickness of each of these rings matches exactly the vertical limits of
the inclined orbit of its source moon.
