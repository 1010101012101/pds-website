**Caption:**

A mosaic of four images taken through the clear filter (610
nanometers) of the solid state imaging (CCD) system aboard NASA's
Galileo spacecraft on November 8, 1996, at a resolution of
approximately 46 kilometers (km) per picture element (pixel) along the
rings; however, because the spacecraft was only about 0.5 degrees
above the ring plane, the image is highly foreshortened in the
vertical direction. The images were obtained when Galileo was in
Jupiter's shadow peering back toward the Sun; the ring was
approximately 2,300,000 kilometers (km) away. The arc on the far right
of the image is produced by sunlight scattered by small particles
comprising Jupiter's upper atmospheric haze. The ring also efficiently
scatters light, indicating that much of its brightness is due to
particles that are microns or less in diameter. Such small particles
are believed to have human-scale lifetimes, i.e., very brief compared
to the solar system's age.

Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts -- a flat main ring,
a lenticular halo interior to the main ring, and the gossamer ring,
which lies exterior to the main ring. The near and far arms of
Jupiter's main ring extend horizontally across the mosaic, joining
together at the ring's [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa), on the far left side of the figure. The
near arm of the ring appears to be abruptly truncated close to the
planet, at the point where it passes into Jupiter's shadow. Some
radial structure is barely visible across the ring's [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa). A faint
mist of particles can be seen above and below the main rings; this
vertically extended "halo" is unusual in planetary rings, and is
probably caused by electromagnetic forces pushing the smallest grains
out of the ring plane. Because of shadowing, the halo is not visible
close to Jupiter in the lower right part of the mosaic.

Jupiter's main ring is a thin strand of material encircling the
planet. The diffuse innermost boundary begins at approximately 123,000
km. The main ring's outer radius is found to be at 128,940 +/-50 km,
slightly less than the Voyager value of 129,130 +/-100 km, but very
close to the orbit of the satellite Adrastea (128,980 km).  The main
ring exhibits a marked drop in brightness at 127,849 +/-50 km, lying
almost atop the orbit of the jovian moon Metis at 127,978 km.
Satellites seem to affect the structure of even tenuous rings like
that found at Jupiter.
