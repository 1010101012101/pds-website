**Caption:**

The extremely diffuse gossamer ring which lies outside the main ring.

Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts: a flat main ring, a
toroidal halo interior to the main ring, and the gossamer ring, which
lies exterior to the main ring. The gossamer ring is the extremely
diffuse and uniform band that stretches across the center of this
mosaic, starting from the main ring and halo on the right-hand
side. The gossamer ring had been seen previously only in the single
Voyager image in which it was discovered at a very low brightness
level; there its brightness appeared to drop from about one-tenth the
main ring's value until the ring totally vanished at a distance of
about three Jovian radii. The gossamer ring is clearly visible in this
Galileo view; the left side of the image corresponds to a radial
distance of about 2.2 Jovian radii. The outer edge of the gossamer
ring is beyond the edge of this mosaic.

**Jupiter's gossamer ring**

To accentuate the very faint, gossamer ring, the images were
overexposed with respect to the main ring and the halo (both seen on
the far right of the mosaic). In these long exposures, some stars are
visible; other specks in the mosaic were caused by cosmic ray hits to
the CCD. All parts of the Jovian rings scatter sunlight very
efficiently in the forward direction, indicating that the particles
are micrometers or less in diameter, small than the thickness of
tissue paper. Such small particles are believed to have human-scale
lifetimes, i.e., very brief compared to the solar system's age.

These images were taken through the clear filter (610 nanometers) of
the solid state imaging (CCD) system aboard NASA's Galileo spacecraft
on November 9, 1996.  The resolution is approximately 46 kilometers
per picture element from right to left; however, because the
spacecraft was only about 0.5 degrees above the ring plane, the image
is highly foreshortened in the vertical direction. The images were
obtained when Galileo was in Jupiter's shadow, peering back toward the
Sun; the ring was approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million
miles) away. Jupiter lies about a full frame off the right edge.

The view of Earth's moon included in the explanatory graphics was
created from imagery returned by the BMDO/NASA Clementine lunar
orbiter which was launched in early 1994. (BMDO is Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization.)
