**Caption: **      **Original Caption Released with Image: **      The rings of Jupiter proved to be unexpectedly bright when seen with the Sun nearly behind them. Strong forward scattering of sunlight is characteristic of small particles. This view was obtained by Voyager 2 on July 10 from a perspective inside the shadow of Jupiter. The distance of the spacecraft from the rings was about 1.5 million kilometers. Although the resolution has been degraded by camera motion during the time exposures, these images reveal the rings have some radial structure.  

**Image Note:**     PICNO 0206J2+001, Caption is from 'Voyage to Jupiter' NASA SP-439 (p.112)
