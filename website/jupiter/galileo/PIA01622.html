**Caption:**

Galileo image of Jupiter's Main Ring and Halo.

The top and bottom panels show a mosaic of images of Jupiter's rings
taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft. Jupiter is to the right of this
mosaic, and different brightness scales accent different parts of the
ring system. Jupiter's ring system has three parts -- a flat main
ring; a halo inside the main ring shaped like a double-convex lens;
and the gossamer ring outside the main ring. In the top view, a faint
mist of particles is seen above and below the main ring. This
vertically extended "halo" is unusual in planetary rings, and is
caused by electromagnetic forces pushing the smallest grains, which
carry electric charges, out of the ring plane.

**Development of Jupiter's Main Ring and Halo**

Jupiter's main ring is a thin sheet of material encircling the
planet. The near and far arms of this ring extend horizontally across
the mosaic, joining together at the ring's <A HREF="/glossary.html#ansa">ansa</A>, the portion visible
on the sides of Jupiter, on the figure's far left side. In the bottom
view, some radial structure is visible across the ring's <A HREF="/glossary.html#ansa">ansa</A>. The
diffuse innermost boundary begins at approximately 122,500 kilometers
(about 76,100 miles). The main ring's outer radius is at about 128,940
kilometers (80,120 miles), very close to the orbit of the Jovian moon
Adrastea (128,980 kilometers or 80,140 miles). The brightness of the
main ring drops markedly at about 127,850 kilometers (79,440 miles),
very near the orbit of another moon, Metis, at 127,978 kilometers
(79,521 miles). Jupiter's four small satellites, Metis, Adrastea,
Amalthea and Thebe, affect the structure of the huge planet's tenuous
rings.

These images were taken through the clear filter of Galileo's onboard
solid state imaging camera system on November 9, 1996.  The resolution
is approximately 24 kilometers (14 miles) per picture element along
Jupiter's rings. Because the spacecraft was only about 0.5 degrees
above the ring plane, the image is highly foreshortened
vertically. The images were obtained when Galileo was in Jupiter's
shadow, peering back toward the Sun, when the ring was approximately
2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) away. The view of Earth's
moon in the explanatory graphics was created from images returned by
the Clementine lunar orbiter, launched in 1994 by NASA and the
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.
