**Caption:**

Image showing structure of Jupiter's Gossamer Ring.

This mosaic of five images was taken through the clear filter (610
nanometers) of the solid state imaging system (CCD) aboard NASA's
Galileo spacecraft on October 5, 1996. The mosaic is shown twice; the
top panel displays only the data, while the bottom panel gives the
location of some of Jupiter's small ring moons and presents a match
between the image and a simple geometrical model of the gossamer
rings.  From the spacecraft's distance of approximately 6.6 million
kilometers (km), the images have a resolution of about 134 km per
pixel (picture element). The images were acquired when Galileo was in
Jupiter's shadow, peering back toward the Sun, hidden behind the
planet. The spacecraft was located only about 0.15 degrees above the
ring plane at the time, making the images highly foreshortened in the
vertical direction. North is to the bottom.

The white vertical arc at the left edge of the top panel is caused by
sunlight filtering through Jupiter's upper atmosphere; the white
horizontal line in the left part of the figure is the main ring whose
arms overlap in this foreshortened view. The next frame of the mosaic,
taken at higher sensitivity to detect fainter material, shows (on the
left part of this panel) the overexposed main ring and the halo (seen
as material above and below the main ring) which is interior to the
main ring and has become visible in this longer exposure. The middle
panel, taken at twenty times the standard sensitivity, shows a tenuous
horizontal stripe, which can be made out in the "10 times sensitivity
panel also. In contrast to the main ring, which ends in a narrow
elliptical tip, this "gossamer ring" ends abruptly (in the middle of
the image) without changing its vertical thickness; the ring is also
unusual in that its top and bottom edges are about twice as bright as
the central region. Interestingly this ring is only seen to precisely
the orbital distance of Amalthea, a small (mean radius of 85 km)
Jovian moon, and has a half-thickness that is the same as Amalthea's
maximum excursion off Jupiter's equatorial plane.

Further to the right, using much higher sensitivities, another faint
but wider stripe becomes visible. This last band is associated with
Thebe, a Jovian moon with a mean radius of 50 km. The ring lies
principally inside Thebe's orbit and has a thickness like Thebe's
elevation above Jupiter's equatorial plane. Given the position of
Adrastea (in the equatorial plane at the periphery of the main Jovian
ring), the main ring is likely derived from this small satellite (mean
radius of 8 km).

The bottom rendition shows the orbital distances (in yellow) of the
small satellites. The distances are given in units of Jovian radii;
Jupiter's radius is 71,398 kilometers (44,267 miles). Various
components of the Jovian ring system are plotted as seen from the
equatorial plane: the green band represents the positions of particles
lost from Amalthea; the red band is material from Thebe.
