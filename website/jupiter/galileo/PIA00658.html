**Caption:**

A mosaic of four images taken through the clear filter (610
nanometers) of the solid state imaging (CCD) system aboard NASA's
Galileo spacecraft on November 8, 1996, at a resolution of
approximately 46 kilometers (km) per picture element (pixel) along the
rings; however, because the spacecraft was only about 0.5 degrees
above the ring plane, the image is highly foreshortened in the
vertical direction. The images were obtained when Galileo was in
Jupiter's shadow peering back toward the Sun; the ring was
approximately 2,300,000 kilometers (km) away. The arc on the far right
of the image is produced by sunlight scattered by small particles
comprising Jupiter's upper atmospheric haze. The ring also efficiently
scatters light, indicating that much of its brightness is due to
particles that are microns or less in diameter. Such small particles
are believed to have human-scale lifetimes, i.e., very brief compared
to the solar system's age.

Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts -- a flat main ring,
a lenticular halo interior to the main ring, and the gossamer ring, which
lies exterior to the main ring. The near and far arms of Jupiter's main
ring extend horizontally across the mosaic, joining together at the
ring's [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa), on the far left side of the figure. The near arm of the
ring appears to be abruptly truncated close to the planet, at the point
where it passes into Jupiter's shadow.

A faint mist of particles can be seen above and below the main rings;
this vertically extended, toroidal "halo" is unusual in planetary
rings, and is probably caused by electromagnetic forces which can push
small grains out of the ring plane.  Halo material is present across
this entire image, implying that it reaches more than 27,000 km above
the ring plane. Because of shadowing, the halo is not visible close to
Jupiter in the lower right part of the mosaic. In order to accentuate
faint features in the image, different brightnesses are shown through
color, with the brightest being white or yellow and the faintest
purple.
