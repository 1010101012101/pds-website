**Caption:**

Galileo image C0416076420 shows the dark side of the Galilean moon Europa, lit
exclusively by light scattered back from Jupiter. The image was taken during
the C10 encounter at a very high [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) of
178.8 degrees. The ring system, nearly edge-on, was captured as well. The
image has been enhanced in false color to show the structures more clearly.
The tip of the main ring is in white and it expands into the halo near the
right edge. The faint stripe of blue extending outward from the tip is part of
the gossamer ring, a cloud of dust ejected from the moon Amalthea.
