**Caption: **

The ring system of Jupiter was imaged by the Galileo spacecraft on November 9,
1996. In this image the west [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa) of Jupiter's main
ring is seen at a resolution of 24 kilometers per pixel. The ring clearly
shows radial structure that had only been hinted at in the Voyager images. The
plot of the brightness of ring as a function of location, going from the
inner-most edge of the image to the outer-most through the thickest part of
the ring, shows the "dips" in brightness due to perturbations from satellites.
Two small satellites, Adrastea and Metis, which are not seen in this image,
orbit through the outer portion of the [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa); their
location relative to these radial features will be available after further
data analysis. The ring's faint halo is seen to arise in the inner main ring
just as it fades. Although most of Jupiter's ring is composed of small grains
that should be highly perturbed by the strong Jovian magnetosphere, the ring's
brightness drops abruptly at the outer edge.
