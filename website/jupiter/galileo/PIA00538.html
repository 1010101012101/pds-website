**Caption:**

Image of the Main Ring of Jupiter taken through clear filter.

The ring system of Jupiter was imaged by the Galileo
spacecraft on November 9, 1996. In this image the west [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa) of Jupiter's
main ring is seen at a resolution of 24 kilometers per pixel. The ring
clearly shows radial structure that had only been hinted at in the
Voyager images. The plot of the brightness of ring as a function of
location, going from the inner-most edge of the image to the outer-most
through the thickest part of the ring, shows the "dips" in brightness due
to perturbations from satellites. Two small satellites, Adrastea and
Metis, which are not seen in this image, orbit through the outer portion
of the [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa); their location relative to these radial features will be
available after further data analysis. The ring's faint halo is seen to
arise in the inner main ring just as it fades. Although most of Jupiter's
ring is composed of small grains that should be highly perturbed by the
strong Jovian magnetosphere, the ring's brightness drops abruptly at the
outer edge.
