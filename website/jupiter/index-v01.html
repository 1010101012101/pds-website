# Jupiter's Ring System

Jupiter's ring was discovered by Voyager 1 in a single image that was targeted
specifically to search for a faint ring system. Subsequently, Voyager 2 was
reprogrammed to take a more complete set of images. The ring is now known to
be composed of three major components. The _main ring_ is about 7000 km wide
and has an abrupt outer boundary 128,940 km from the center of the planet. The
main ring encompasses the orbits of two small moons, Adrastea and Metis, which
may act as the source for the dust that makes up most of the ring. At its
inner edge the main ring merges gradually into the _halo_. The halo is a
broad, faint torus of material about 10,000 km thick and extending halfway
from the main ring down to the planet's cloudtops. Just outside the main ring
is a pair of broad and exceedingly faint _gossamer rings_, one bounded by the
orbit of the moon Amalthea and the other by the orbit of Thebe.

* [ A Jupiter "Day"](/jupiter/animations/jupiter_160.mov) (QuickTime (MOV) format, **2.6 Mbytes**) 

Jupiter and its ring system as seen from the surface of the moon Io. The ring
grows in brightness as Io goes around to the dark side of Jupiter because the
ring's dust scatters light very efficiently at high [phase
angles](/glossary.html#phase_angle). The tiny moons Adrastea and Metis, which
are embedded within the rings, can also be seen. This was a full motion NASA
video converted to QuickTime format.
