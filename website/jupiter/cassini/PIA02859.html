First pictures that NASA's Cassini spacecraft has taken of the ring

Jupiter's main ring is a narrow structure about 6,000 kilometers (about
3,700 miles) in width and about 100,000 times fainter than the planet
it encircles. These are the first pictures that NASA's Cassini
spacecraft has taken of the ring, a portion of which appears in each
frame as an arc opening toward the right.

Image processing helped make the ring easier to see in these frames
taken with Cassini's narrow-angle camera during a 39.5-hour period
beginning Dec. 11, 2000. The distance between the spacecraft and
Jupiter narrowed during those hours, from 20.3 million kilometers (12.6
million miles) to 19 million kilometers (11.8 million miles). Also,
Cassini's movement took it from 3.3 degrees above the plane of the
rings to 2.98 degrees above the plane. The frames are in sequence from
upper left to lower right. The image of the ring's arc grows longer, as
the spacecraft approaches the planet.

Resolution is about 230 kilometers (143 miles) per pixel. The 10 frames
shown here are each a small section of several separate narrow-angle
images taken through the camera's clear filter and spanning the entire
39.5 hour period. The scattered light background has been removed, and
the images have been contrast-stretched to enhance the ring. The
contours in the image, as well as the small variations in brightness of
the ring from one frame to the next, are a result of the image
processing and background removal.

This image sequence also shows the motions of two satellites embedded
in Jupiter's ring. The moon Adrastea is the fainter of the two, and
Metis is the brighter. Images such as these will be used to refine the
orbits of the two bodies. This image sequence also shows the motions of

Cassini is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and
the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of
the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the Cassini
mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
