# Satellite Rings Movie

![Animated GIF](PIA02872a.gif)

Motion, over 16 hour-period, of two satellites embedded in Jupiter's ring.

This brief movie clip (of which the release image is a still frame),
taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft as it approached Jupiter, shows the
motions, over a 16 hour-period, of two satellites embedded in Jupiter's
ring. The moon Adrastea is the fainter of the two, and Metis is the
brighter. Images such as these will be used to refine the orbits of the
two bodies.

The movie was made from images taken during a 40-hour sequence of the
Jovian ring on December 11, 2000.

Cassini is a cooperative mission of NASA, the European Space Agency and
the Italian Space Agency. JPL, a division of the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena, manages Cassini for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C.
