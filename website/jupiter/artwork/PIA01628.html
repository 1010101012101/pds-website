Schematic depictions of the structures of Jupiter's main and gossamer rings.

The schematic structures of Jupiter's main and gossamer rings are
depicted here. Scientists studying data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft
have found that the ring system is made up of impact debris created
when meteoroids, which are fragments of comets and asteroids, slam
into Jupiter`s four smallest satellites.

The top panel shows that the main ring (red) is formed mostly from
meteoroid impact debris kicked up from the innermost moons, Metis (m)
and Adrastea (a). Since both satellites orbit in paths not inclined to
Jupiter's equator, the main ring appears as a narrow line.

The middle panel shows the additional effect of dust ejected from the
satellite Amalthea (A), responsible for producing one of the two moon
components of the gossamer ring. Amalthea's orbit is inclined to
Jupiter's equatorial plane, and at different times the satellite's
vertical position can range anywhere between the two extreme limits
shown. Dust ejected from Amalthea (orange) produces a ring whose
thickness equals Amalthea's vertical projections beyond Jupiter's
equatorial plane.

The lower panel shows the additional effect of dust ejected from Thebe
(T), which makes up the second component (shown in green) of the
gossamer ring. Again, the two positions shown represent the maximum
projections of Thebe from Jupiter's equatorial plane. This component
of the gossamer ring is thicker than the component due to Amaltheas
dust because Thebe's orbit is more inclined than that of Amalthea.

The Jupiter image was created from a map based on data obtained by the
Hubble Space Telescope.
