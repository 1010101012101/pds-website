**Caption: **

The schematic structures of Jupiter's main and gossamer rings are depicted
here. Scientists studying data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft have found that
the ring system is made up of impact debris created when meteoroids, which are
fragments of comets and asteroids, slam into Jupiter`s four smallest
satellites.

The top panel shows that the main ring (red) is formed mostly from meteoroid
impact debris kicked up from the innermost moons, Metis (m) and Adrastea (a).
Since both satellites orbit in paths not inclined to Jupiter's equator, the
main ring appears as a narrow line.

The middle panel shows the additional effect of dust ejected from the
satellite Amalthea (A), responsible for producing one of the two moon
components of the gossamer ring. Amalthea's orbit is inclined to Jupiter's
equatorial plane, and at different times the satellite's vertical position can
range anywhere between the two extreme limits shown. Dust ejected from
Amalthea (orange) produces a ring whose thickness equals Amalthea's vertical
projections beyond Jupiter's equatorial plane.

**Satellite Interactions with Jupiter's Ring System**

The lower panel shows the additional effect of dust ejected from Thebe (T),
which makes up the second component (shown in green) of the gossamer ring.
Again, the two positions shown represent the maximum projections of Thebe from
Jupiter's equatorial plane. This component of the gossamer ring is thicker
than the component due to Amaltheas dust because Thebe's orbit is more
inclined than that of Amalthea.

The Jupiter image was created from a map based on data obtained by the Hubble
Space Telescope.
