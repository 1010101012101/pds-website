Cut-away View of Jupiter's Inner Satellites and Ring Components

This schematic cut-away view of the components of Jupiter's ring
system shows the geometry of the rings in relation to Jupiter and to
the small inner satellites, which are the source of the dust which
forms the rings.

**The Formation of Jupiter's Ring System**

The innermost and thickest ring, shown in gray shading, is the halo
that ends at the main ring. The thin, narrow main ring, shown with red
shading, is bounded by the 16- kilometer-wide (10-miles) satellite
Adrastea and shows a marked decrease in brightness near the orbit of
Jupiter's innermost moon, Metis. It is composed of fine particles
knocked off Adrastea and Metis. Although the orbits of Adrastea and
Metis are about 1,000 kilometers (about 600 miles) apart, that
separation is not depicted in this drawing. Impacts by small
meteoroids (fragments of asteroids and comets) into these small,
low-gravity satellites feed material into the rings. Thebe and
Amalthea, the next two satellites in increasing distance from Jupiter,
supply dust which forms the thicker, disk-like "gossamer" rings. The
gossamer rings, depicted with yellow and green shading, are thicker
because the source satellites orbit Jupiter on inclined paths

**Satellite Interactions with Jupiter's Ring System**

These small satellites all orbit closer to Jupiter than the four
largest Galilean satellites, Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto, which
were discovered nearly 400 years ago. The orbital distances of the
moons are drawn relative to the size of Jupiter.
