**Caption: **

Jupiter's faint ring system is shown in this color composite as two light
orange lines protruding from the left toward Jupiter's limb. This picture was
taken in Jupiter's shadow through orange and violet filters. The colorful
images of Jupiter's bright limb are evidence of the spacecraft motion during
these long exposures. The Voyager 2 spacecraft was at a range of 1,450,000
kilometers (900,000 miles) about two degrees below the plane of the ring. The
lower ring image was cut short by Jupiter's shadow on the ring.

JPL manages the Voyager project for NASA's Office of Space Science.
