**Caption:**

Jupiter's faint ring system is shown in this color composite as two
light orange lines protruding from the left toward Jupiter's limb.
This picture was taken in Jupiter's shadow through orange and violet
filters.  The colorful images of Jupiter's bright limb are evidence of
the spacecraft motion during these long exposures.  The Voyager 2
spacecraft was at a range of 1,450,000 kilometers (900,000 miles)
about two degrees below the plane of the ring.  The lower ring image
was cut short by Jupiter's shadow on the ring.

JPL manages the Voyager project for NASA's Office of Space Science.
