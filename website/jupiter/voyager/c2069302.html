The rings of Jupiter proved to be unexpectedly bright when seen with the Sun
nearly behind them. Strong forward scattering of sunlight is characteristic of
small particles. This view was obtained by Voyager 2 on July 10 from a
perspective inside the shadow of Jupiter. The distance of the spacecraft from
the rings was about 1.5 million kilometers. Although the resolution has been
degraded by camera motion during the time exposures, these images reveal the
rings have some radial structure.
