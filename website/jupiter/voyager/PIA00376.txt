Rings of Jupiter Star Trail

Trails due to camera motion can be seen in this rings image.

The rings of Jupiter proved to be unexpectedly bright when seen with
the Sun nearly behind them. Strong forward scattering of sunlight is
characteristic of small particles. This view was obtained by Voyager 2
on July 10 from a perspective inside the shadow of Jupiter. The
distance of the spacecraft from the rings was about 1.5 million
kilometers. Although the resolution has been degraded by camera motion
during the time exposures, these images reveal the rings have some
radial structure.
