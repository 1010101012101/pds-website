     Note: This JPEG image is made available in order to share with the
     public the excitement of new discoveries being made via the NASA/JPL
     Galileo spacecraft. Galileo scientists are in the process of
     calibrating and validating this data. The full digital image necessary
     for scientific analysis will be released within one year of receipt of
     this orbit's last data.

Original Caption Released with Image:
     The ring system of Jupiter was imaged by the Galileo spacecraft on
     November 9, 1996. In this image the west ansa of Jupiter's main ring is
     seen at a resolution of 24 kilometers per pixel. The ring clearly shows
     radial structure that had only been hinted at in the Voyager images.
     The plot of the brightness of ring as a function of location, going
     from the inner-most edge of the image to the outer-most through the
     thickest part of the ring, shows the "dips" in brightness due to
     perturbations from satellites. Two small satellites, Adrastea and
     Metis, which are not seen in this image, orbit through the outer
     portion of the ansa; their location relative to these radial features
     will be available after further data analysis. The ring's faint halo is
     seen to arise in the inner main ring just as it fades. Although most of
     Jupiter's ring is composed of small grains that should be highly
     perturbed by the strong Jovian magnetosphere, the ring's brightness
     drops abruptly at the outer edge.

     The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA manages the mission for
     NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, DC.
