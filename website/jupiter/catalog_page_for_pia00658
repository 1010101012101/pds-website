     Note: This JPEG image is made available in order to share with the
     public the excitement of new discoveries being made via the NASA/JPL
     Galileo spacecraft. Galileo scientists are in the process of
     calibrating and validating this data. The full digital image necessary
     for scientific analysis will be released within one year of receipt of
     this orbit's last data.

Original Caption Released with Image:
     A mosaic of four images taken through the clear filter (610 nanometers)
     of the solid state imaging (CCD) system aboard NASA's Galileo
     spacecraft on November 8, 1996, at a resolution of approximately 46
     kilometers (km) per picture element (pixel) along the rings; however,
     because the spacecraft was only about 0.5 degrees above the ring plane,
     the image is highly foreshortened in the vertical direction. The images
     were obtained when Galileo was in Jupiter's shadow peering back toward
     the Sun; the ring was approximately 2,300,000 kilometers (km) away. The
     arc on the far right of the image is produced by sunlight scattered by
     small particles comprising Jupiter's upper atmospheric haze. The ring
     also efficiently scatters light, indicating that much of its brightness
     is due to particles that are microns or less in diameter. Such small
     particles are believed to have human-scale lifetimes, i.e., very brief
     compared to the solar system's age.

     Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts -- a flat main ring, a
     lenticular halo interior to the main ring, and the gossamer ring, which
     lies exterior to the main ring. The near and far arms of Jupiter's main
     ring extend horizontally across the mosaic, joining together at the
     ring's ansa, on the far left side of the figure. The near arm of the
     ring appears to be abruptly truncated close to the planet, at the point
     where it passes into Jupiter's shadow.

     A faint mist of particles can be seen above and below the main rings;
     this vertically extended, toroidal "halo" is unusual in planetary
     rings, and is probably caused by electromagnetic forces which can push
     small grains out of the ring plane. Halo material is present across
     this entire image, implying that it reaches more than 27,000 km above
     the ring plane. Because of shadowing, the halo is not visible close to
     Jupiter in the lower right part of the mosaic. In order to accentuate
     faint features in the image, different brightnesses are shown through
     color, with the brightest being white or yellow and the faintest
     purple.
