**Caption:**

The Jovian ring was imaged in the infrared (2.26 microns wavelength) at
approximately 7:00 UT on 12 July, 1994, from NASA's Infrared Telescope
Facility. This image was obtained by Philip Esterle (University of Maryland),
Casey Lisse (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), and Mark Shure (University of
Hawaii). It was part of a program to monitor the effects of the dust from
Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on the Jovian ring system. The ring is visible in false
color as a pair of faint lines extending outward from the (severely
overexposed) disk of Jupiter.
