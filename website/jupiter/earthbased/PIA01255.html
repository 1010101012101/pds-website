**Caption:**

Probing Jupiter's atmosphere for the first time, the Hubble Space
Telescope's new Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer
(NICMOS) provides a sharp glimpse of the planet's ring, moon, and
high-altitude clouds.

The presence of methane in Jupiter's hydrogen- and helium- rich
atmosphere has allowed NICMOS to plumb Jupiter's atmosphere, revealing
bands of high-altitude clouds. Visible light observations cannot
provide a clear view of these high clouds because the underlying
clouds reflect so much visible light that the higher level clouds are
indistinguishable from the lower layer. The methane gas between the
main cloud deck and the high clouds absorbs the reflected infrared
light, allowing those clouds that are above most of the atmosphere to
appear bright. Scientists will use NICMOS to study the high altitude
portion of Jupiter's atmosphere to study clouds at lower levels. They
will then analyze those images along with visible light information to
compile a clearer picture of the planet's weather. Clouds at different
levels tell unique stories. On Earth, for example, ice crystal
(cirrus) clouds are found at high altitudes while water (cumulus)
clouds are at lower levels.

Besides showing details of the planet's high-altitude clouds, NICMOS
also provides a clear view of the ring and the moon, Metis. Jupiter's
ring plane, seen nearly edge-on, is visible as a faint line on the
upper right portion of the NICMOS image. Metis can be seen in the ring
plane (the bright circle on the ring's outer edge). The moon is 25
miles wide and about 80,000 miles from Jupiter.

Because of the near-infrared camera's narrow field of view, this image
is a mosaic constructed from three individual images taken Sept. 17,
1997. The color intensity was adjusted to accentuate the high-altitude
clouds. The dark circle on the disk of Jupiter (center of image) is an
artifact of the imaging system.
