     Note: This JPEG image is made available in order to share with the
     public the excitement of new discoveries being made via the NASA/JPL
     Galileo spacecraft. Galileo scientists are in the process of
     calibrating and validating this data. The full digital image necessary
     for scientific analysis will be released within one year of receipt of
     this orbit's last data.

Original Caption Released with Image:
     A mosaic of two images taken through the clear filter (610 nanometers)
     of the solid state imaging system (CCD) aboard NASA's Galileo
     spacecraft on November 8, 1996, at a resolution of approximately 46
     kilometers (km) per picture element (pixel) from right to left;
     however, because the spacecraft was only about 0.5 degree above the
     ring plane, the image is highly foreshortened in the vertical
     direction. The images were obtained when Galileo was in Jupiter's
     shadow peering back toward the Sun; the ring was approximately
     2,300,000 kilometers (km) away and Jupiter's limb lies about a full
     frame off the right edge.

     Jupiter's ring system is composed of three parts -- a flat main ring, a
     toroidal halo interior to the main ring, and the gossamer ring, which
     lies exterior to the main ring. In order to accentuate the very faint
     gossamer ring, the images were overexposed with respect to the main
     ring and the halo (both seen on the far right of the mosaic). Because
     of the long exposure, some stars are visible in the figure; other
     specks in the figure were caused by cosmic ray hits to the CCD. All
     parts of the jovian rings efficiently forward-scatter light, indicating
     that most brightness is due to particles that are microns or less in
     diameter. Such small particles are believed to have human-scale
     lifetimes, i.e., very brief compared to the solar system's age.

     The gossamer ring is the extremely diffuse and uniform band that
     stretches across the center of this figure, starting from the main ring
     and halo on the right-hand side. The gossamer ring had only been seen
     previously in the single Voyager image in which it was discovered at a
     very low brightness level; there its brightness appeared to drop from
     about one tenth the main ring's value until the ring totally vanished
     at a distance of about three jovian radii. The gossamer ring is clearly
     visible here and appears slightly more uniform than in the Voyager
     images; the left side of the image corresponds to a radial distance of
     about 2.2 jovian radii.

     NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, DC.
