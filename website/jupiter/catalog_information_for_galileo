Original Caption Released with Image:
     Galileo's first view of Amalthea, a small inner moon of Jupiter,
     showing the end of the elongated satellite that faces permanently
     toward the giant planet. North is to the top of the picture and the Sun
     illuminates the surface from the left. The circular feature that
     dominates the upper-right portion of the disk is Pan, the largest
     crater on Amalthea. This crater is about 90 kilometers wide. The bright
     spot at the south pole is associated with another, slightly smaller
     crater named Gaea. The Universal Time is 8 hours, 18 minutes, 0 seconds
     on the 7th of September, 1996.

     The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA manages the mission for
     NASA'is Office of Space Science, Washington , DC.
