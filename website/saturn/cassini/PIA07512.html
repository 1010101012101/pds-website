**Caption:**

This amazing close-up of Saturn's rings reveals their incredible variety.
In some regions there are wavelike structures, while in other places the
rings' structure appears to be more chaotic.

This image shows (from top to bottom) the A ring with the Encke gap, the
Cassini Division, and the B and C rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on April 26, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3
million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 14
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
