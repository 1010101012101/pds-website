Plumes of icy material extend above the southern polar region of Saturn's moon
Enceladus as imaged by the Cassini spacecraft in February 2005. The monochrome
view is presented along with a color-coded version on the right. The latter
reveals a fainter and much more extended plume component.

Images like these are being analyzed by scientists as they seek to explain the
processes that could be producing such incredible features. As reported in the
journal Science on March 10, 2006, imaging scientists believe that the plumes
are geysers erupting from pressurized subsurface reservoirs of liquid water
above 273 degrees Kelvin (0 degrees Celsius).

Another plume view,
[PIA07801](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07801), was taken one
month earlier and looks broadside at the moon's prominent "tiger stripe"
fractures. In the January view, the plume appears to have a single component.
This (February) view looks along the tiger stripe fractures and reveals both a
large and a small component to the plume; the smaller, fainter component is
separated from the main plume by about 100 kilometers (60 miles).

See [PIA06247](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06247) for a view
of the tiger stripe features.

This clear-filter image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera at a distance of approximately 321,000 kilometers (199,000 miles) from
Enceladus at a Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 153 degrees. The
image scale is approximately 1.8 kilometers (1.1 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
