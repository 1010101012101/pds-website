**Caption:**

Cassini looks up from beneath the ringplane to spot Prometheus and Atlas 
orbiting between Saturn's A and F rings. 

Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across. Atlas is 20 kilometers (12 
miles) across.

The F ring displays its characteristic clumps, while scientists are 
watching diligently for signs of tiny, embedded moons. Prometheus is 
responsible for some of the clumpy structure in the F ring.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 28, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3 
million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 
about 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
