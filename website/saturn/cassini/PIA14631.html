Saturn's moon Mimas appears near Saturn, dwarfed by its parent planet in this
image.

Mimas (246 miles, or 396 kilometers across) appears tiny compared to the
storms clearly visible in far northern and southern hemispheres of Saturn.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18
degrees below the ringplane. North on Saturn is up and rotated 27 degrees to
the left.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug. 20,
2012 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 64 degrees. Image scale is 87 miles
(140 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
