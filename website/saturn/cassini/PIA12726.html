A small crescent of the moon Rhea is dwarfed by the larger crescent of Saturn.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) can be seen in the upper right of
the image. This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the
rings from about 3 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on July 15, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 98 degrees. Image scale is 153
kilometers (95 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
