**Caption:**

Seen from a viewpoint nearly coincident with the ringplane, the bright arc 
within the G ring appears even brighter with its ring material 
concentrated in the center of this image.

This partial arc is much narrower than the ring and extends only one-sixth 
of the way around the G ring. The arc is 250 kilometers (150-miles) wide 
and extends 150,000 kilometers (93,000 miles) in orbital longitude. The 
collection of particles that make up the arc is held in place by a 
resonance, or gravitational disturbance, from the moon Mimas.

The motion of the spacecraft smeared background stars into streaks because 
the camera needed a very long exposure time of 26 seconds to capture light 
reflected from the faint ring. The image was taken in visible light with 
the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 28, 2009. This view 
looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from just barely below the 
ringplane.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.2 million 
kilometers (750,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
