Long shadows stretch away from the towering edge waves created by the gravity
of the moon Daphnis in this image taken a little more than a week before
Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

Tiny Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) appears as a bright dot in the
Keeler Gap near the tall edge waves it has created in the A ring. The moon has
an inclined orbit and its gravitational pull both perturbs the orbits of the
particles of the A ring forming the Keeler Gap's edge and sculpts the edge
into waves having both horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components.
Material on the inner edge of the gap orbits faster than the moon so that the
waves there lead the moon in its orbit. Material on the outer edge moves
slower than the moon, so waves there trail the moon. See
[PIA11656](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11656) to learn more
about this process. Both the moon and the edge waves can be seen casting
shadows in this image.

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 38 degrees above the ringplane. Background stars, including three stars
shining through the rings, are visibly elongated by the motion of the
spacecraft during the image's exposure.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 28, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
983,000 kilometers (611,000 miles) from Daphnis. Image scale is 6 kilometers
(4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
