**Caption:**

Saturn wears a halo of four moons in this wide angle camera image taken 
by the Cassini spacecraft on August 18, 2004.

Satellites visible in this image are (clockwise from upper left): Tethys 
(1060 kilometers, or 659 miles wide); Dione (1118 kilometers or 695 miles 
wide); Enceladus (499 kilometers or 310 miles wide); and Mimas (398 
kilometers or 247 miles wide).

The image was taken in visible red light at a distance of 8.9 million 
kilometers (5.5 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 529 
kilometers (329 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
