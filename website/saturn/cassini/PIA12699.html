Bright spokes grace Saturn's B ring in this Cassini spacecraft snapshot that
also features a couple of the planet's moons large and small.

Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) can be seen in the upper left of
the image. Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) appears as a small
speck beyond the thin F ring near the center left of the image. The spokes are
particularly noticeable on the far right of the image. See
[PIA12605](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12605) to learn more
about spokes.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane. Pandora has been brightened by a factor of two
relative to the rings and Dione to enhance visibility. Dione is overexposed
here.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on May 30, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.9 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 104 degrees. Image scale is 111 kilometers (69
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
