This magnified view illustrates the general orientation of the "propeller"
features in Saturn's rings as they orbit the planet. The propellers are
features detected in Cassini images that reveal the gravitational influence of
moonlets approximately 100 meters (300 feet) in diameter.

The view is from one of the two Saturn orbit insertion images, taken on July
1, 2004, in which the propellers were discovered.

The two dashes of the propeller are oriented in the direction of orbital
motion. The "leading" dash is also slightly closer to Saturn; this "radial
offset" is about 300 meters (1000 feet). The unseen moonlet lies in the center
of the structure.

The grainy appearance of the image is due to magnification and the fact that
the propellers are very faint--just visible above the level of background
noise. Consequently, the image enhancement procedures used have also enhanced
the noise.

This propeller image is identified as "feature 1" in
[PIA07790](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07790). The original
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera image has been magnified from its
original scale for presentation.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
