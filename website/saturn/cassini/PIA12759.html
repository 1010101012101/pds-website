Saturn's moon Janus obscures part of the planet's A ring as the Cassini
spacecraft looks toward the main rings and the thin F ring.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) appears as a dark oval to the left
of the center of the image. A star can also be seen on the right of the image,
beyond the thin F ring.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 21, 2011. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Janus. Image scale is 15
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
