Saturn's moon Janus casts a shadow on the F and A rings while the moon
Prometheus, seen on the left of the image, creates a streamer-channel in the
thin F ring.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers,or 53 miles across)
periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See
[PIA10461](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10461) and
[PIA10593](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10593) to learn more.
To watch a movie of this process, see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

Janus, the moon casting the shadow, is not shown in this image taken as Saturn
approaches its August 2009 equinox. Six background stars are visible. They
appear elongated by the camera's long exposure time.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane and causes out-of-plane structures to cast long shadows
across the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before
and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To
learn more about this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving
across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 28
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 20, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 123 degrees. Image
scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
