**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Janus casts a shadow on the F and A rings while the moon
Prometheus, seen on the left of the image, creates a streamer-channel in
the thin F ring.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers,or 53 miles across)
periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See [PIA10461](PIA10461.html) and
[PIA10593](PIA10593.html) to learn more. To watch a movie of this process, see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html).

Janus, the moon casting the shadow, is not shown in this image taken as
Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox. Six background stars are
visible. They appear elongated by the camera's long exposure time.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane and causes out-of-plane structures to cast long
shadows across the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few
months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about
15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies of
moons' shadows moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html) and
[PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 28
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 20, 2009. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1
million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 123 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
