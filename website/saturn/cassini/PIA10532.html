Prometheus shows up bright in this image of the dark side of the rings.

The bright band that appears above Prometheus in this image is the Cassini
division separating the (very dark) B ring and the A ring. The C ring,
interior to the B ring, is clearly visible.

10532The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Oct. 20, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.076 million
kilometers (668,000 miles) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 26 degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
