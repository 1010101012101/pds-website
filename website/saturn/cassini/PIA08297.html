**Caption:**

As ring particles emerge from the darkness of Saturn's shadow, they pass
through a region of twilight. The Sun's light, refracted by the planet's
atmosphere, peeks around the limb, followed shortly by the Sun itself (see
[PIA08329](PIA08329.html) for an example of this effect).

The "penumbra" is the narrow fringe region of the planet's shadow where
part (but not all) of the Sun is visible around the side of the planet,
creating only a partial shadow there and making the shadow edge look fuzzy.

The A and F rings are captured here. This view looks toward the unlit side
of the rings from about 20 degrees above the ringplane. Two faint ringlets
can be seen within the Encke gap, which stretches out of the blackness at
center and toward right.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 12, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.5
million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 163 degrees. Image scale is
about 9 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
