**Caption:**

This poetic scene shows the giant, smog-enshrouded moon Titan behind
Saturn's nearly edge-on rings. Much smaller Epimetheus (116 kilometers,
or 72 miles across) is just visible to the left of Titan (5,150
kilometers, or 3,200 miles across).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on March 9, 2006, at a distance of approximately 4.1
million kilometers (2.5 million miles) from Titan. The image scale is 25
kilometers (16 miles) per pixel on Titan. The brightness of Epimetheus was
enhanced for visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
