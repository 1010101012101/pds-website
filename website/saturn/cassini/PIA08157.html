This poetic scene shows the giant, smog-enshrouded moon Titan behind Saturn's
nearly edge-on rings. Much smaller Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles
across) is just visible to the left of Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles
across).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 9, 2006, at a distance of approximately 4.1 million kilometers
(2.5 million miles) from Titan. The image scale is 25 kilometers (16 miles)
per pixel on Titan. The brightness of Epimetheus was enhanced for visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
