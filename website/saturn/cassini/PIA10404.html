**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft stares at the Huygens Gap&mdash; the region between
Saturn's outer B ring and the ringlets of the prominent Cassini
Division&mdash;in this high-resolution view.

Ring scientists think that the scrambled pattern seen here in the B ring's
outer edge might represent gravitational clumping of particles
there&mdash;that is, the self-gravity of groups of particles orbiting
together makes them form clumps. This may be due to the fact that this
region is compressed periodically, owing to perturbations by the moon
Mimas. The outer B ring edge (at left) is, in fact, sculpted by an orbital
resonance with Mimas.

The clumping feature may be due to the fact that this region is compressed
periodically, owing to perturbations by Mimas.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 44 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 10, 2008. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 270,000 kilometers (168,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
