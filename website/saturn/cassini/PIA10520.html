**Caption:**

Prometheus, one of the F ring shepherds, is seen here orbiting between the 
A and F rings. The F ring shows a kink near Prometheus, due to the moon's 
gravitational effect.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 15, 2008 at a distance of approximately 
959,000 kilometers (596,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 42 degrees. Image scale is 5 
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
