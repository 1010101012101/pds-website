**Caption:**

This dramatic close-up of Saturn's south pole shows the hurricane-like 
vortex that resides there. The entire polar region is dotted with bright 
clouds, including one that appears to be inside the central ring of the 
polar storm.

The storm was captured in a movie made from Cassini images in November 
2006 (see [PIA08332](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08332)).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a 
combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of polarized 
infrared light. The view was acquired on Jan. 14, 2007 at a distance of 
approximately 963,000 kilometers (598,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale 
is 54 kilometers (34 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
