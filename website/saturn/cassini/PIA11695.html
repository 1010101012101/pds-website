**Caption:**

The small moon Mimas passes in front of the larger moon Rhea, which is
partly obscured by Saturn's rings, in this movie from NASA's Cassini
spacecraft.

Observations of mutual moon-crossing events, in which one moon passes
close to or in front of another, help scientists refine their
understanding of the orbits of Saturn's moons. This movie is a
concatenation of 10 still images obtained over a span of about 6 minutes.
The images were re-projected to a uniform view and computer interpolation
was used to smooth the moons' motions between the frames.

In this video, Mimas (396 kilometers, 246 miles across) moves in front of
the rings. Rhea (1,528 kilometers, 949 miles across) reveals the delicate
separations within the rings as the thin line of the F ring appears before
the backdrop of the mid-southern latitudes of the moon. Mimas travels at
an average speed of 14 kilometers per second (31,000 mph). Rhea's average
speed is about 8 kilometers per second (18,000 mph).

(For other movies like this one, see [PIA11692](PIA11692.html) and [PIA11693](PIA11693.html).)

In this view Rhea, at a distance of approximately 2.7 million kilometers
(1.7 million miles), is farther from Cassini than Mimas. Mimas is closer
to the spacecraft at a distance of approximately 2 million kilometers (1.2
million miles).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just
above the ringplane.

The images were taken in visible light with Cassini's narrow-angle camera
on Oct. 19, 2009. The view was obtained at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 95 degrees. Scale on Mimas is 12 kilometers (7 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
