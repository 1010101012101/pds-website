Bright spokes and the shadow of a moon grace Saturn's B ring in this Cassini
spacecraft image.

Spokes are radial markings scientists continue to study, and they can be seen
here stretching from the far left to upper right of the image. Spokes appear
bright when they are viewed at phase, or Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, angles higher
than about 45 degrees. This image was taken at a phase angle of 50 degrees.
See [PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144) and
[PIA08288](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08288) to learn more.

The moon Mimas is not shown here, but its shadow appears on the rings near the
top of the image. The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox
lowers the sun's angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and
causes out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows
across the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before
and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 9
degrees above the ringplane.The image was taken using a compression scheme
that reduces the image file size on the spacecraft's data recorder, resulting
in the rings' slightly pixelated appearance.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Jan. 11, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
611,000 kilometers (380,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 50 degrees. Image scale is 66 kilometers (41 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
