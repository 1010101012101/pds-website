Surely one of the most gorgeous sights the solar system has to offer, Saturn
sits enveloped by the full splendor of its stately rings.

Taking in the rings in their entirety was the focus of this particular imaging
sequence. Therefore, the camera exposure times were just right to capture the
dark-side of its rings, but longer than that required to properly expose the
globe of sunlit Saturn. Consequently, the sunlit half of the planet is
overexposed.

Between the blinding light of day and the dark of night, there is a strip of
twilight on the globe where colorful details in the atmosphere can be seen.
Bright clouds dot the bluish-grey northern polar region here. In the south,
the planet's night side glows golden in reflected light from the rings' sunlit
face.

Saturn's shadow stretches completely across the rings in this view, taken on
Jan. 19, 2007, in contrast to what Cassini saw when it arrived in 2004 (see
[PIA05429](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05429)).

The view is a mosaic of 36 images -- that is, 12 separate sets of red, green
and blue images -- taken over the course of about 2.5 hours, as Cassini
scanned across the entire main ring system.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 40 degrees above
the ring plane.

The images in this natural-color view were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.23 million
kilometers (764,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 70 kilometers (44
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
