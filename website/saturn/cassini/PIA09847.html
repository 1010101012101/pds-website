**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft captures Janus in the foreground, with Dione in the
distance beyond.

The image was taken two hours after [PIA09842](PIA09842.html), in which Cassini imaged Dione beyond the rings.

Janus is 181 kilometers (113 miles) across. Dione is 1,126 kilometers (700
miles) across. North on the moons is up.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 17, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (766,000 miles) from Janus and 1.6
million kilometers (970,000 miles) from Dione. Image scale is 7 kilometers
(4 miles) per pixel on Janus and 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel on
Dione.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Jan. 20, 2008 using a combination of spectral filters sensitive to
wavelengths of polarized infrared light centered at 938 and 746
nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.3
million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Titan and at a
Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 58 degrees. Image scale is 8
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel. Due to scattering of light by Titan's hazy
atmosphere, the sizes of surface features that can be resolved are a few
times larger than the actual pixel scale.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
