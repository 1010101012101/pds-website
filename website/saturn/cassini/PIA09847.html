The Cassini spacecraft captures Janus in the foreground, with Dione in the
distance beyond.

The image was taken two hours after
[PIA09842](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09842), in which
Cassini imaged Dione beyond the rings.

Janus is 181 kilometers (113 miles) across. Dione is 1,126 kilometers (700
miles) across. North on the moons is up.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 17, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.2 million kilometers (766,000 miles) from Janus and 1.6 million kilometers
(970,000 miles) from Dione. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel on
Janus and 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel on Dione.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan.
20, 2008 using a combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of
polarized infrared light centered at 938 and 746 nanometers. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles)
from Titan and at a Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 58 degrees. Image
scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel. Due to scattering of light by
Titan's hazy atmosphere, the sizes of surface features that can be resolved
are a few times larger than the actual pixel scale.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
