**Caption:**

The complex structure of Saturn's quirky F ring is unfurled in this
mosaic made up of images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The mosaic covers 255 degrees of longitude within the F ring, which
represents about 70 percent of the ring's circumference around Saturn.
From top to bottom, the mosaic represents an area 1,500 kilometers
(930 miles) in radial width.

The 107 images used to create the mosaic were processed to make the
ring appear as if it has been straightened, making it easier to see the ring's
structure. Here, the vertical axis represents distance from Saturn and the
horizontal axis represents longitude around Saturn. This frame of reference
is centered on the bright core of the F ring, at the vertical center of the
mosaic. In this system, the core is considered to be stationary; objects closer
to Saturn (or below vertical center) move toward right, and objects farther from
Saturn (here, above the core) move toward left.

Ring scientists now understand a great deal about what causes the various
features in the ring. In addition to the powerful perturbing effect of the moon
prometheus ([PIA07750](PIA07750.html)), there is thought to be a
population of small objects in the F-ring region that interact with the ring's core
to produce the structures seen (see [PIA07716](PIA07716.html)). Two of the
images had flaws, which caused the vertical lines seen on the right side of
the mosaic. There is also a faint, roughly vertical, wavelike pattern in the view,
which is an artifact of the process used to straighten the ring's shape.

The clear spectral filter images in this mosaic were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 31, 2007, at a distance of about
2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
