The complex structure of Saturn's quirky F ring is unfurled in this mosaic
made up of images taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The mosaic covers 255 degrees of longitude within the F ring, which represents
about 70 percent of the ring's circumference around Saturn. From top to
bottom, the mosaic represents an area 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) in radial
width.

The 107 images used to create the mosaic were processed to make the ring
appear as if it has been straightened, making it easier to see the ring's
structure. Here, the vertical axis represents distance from Saturn and the
horizontal axis represents longitude around Saturn. This frame of reference is
centered on the bright core of the F ring, at the vertical center of the
mosaic. In this system, the core is considered to be stationary; objects
closer to Saturn (or below vertical center) move toward right, and objects
farther from Saturn (here, above the core) move toward left.

Ring scientists now understand a great deal about what causes the various
features in the ring. In addition to the powerful perturbing effect of the
moon prometheus
([PIA07750](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07750)), there is
thought to be a population of small objects in the F-ring region that interact
with the ring's core to produce the structures seen (see
[PIA07716](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07716)). Two of the
images had flaws, which caused the vertical lines seen on the right side of
the mosaic. There is also a faint, roughly vertical, wavelike pattern in the
view, which is an artifact of the process used to straighten the ring's shape.

The clear spectral filter images in this mosaic were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 31, 2007, at a distance of about 2
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
