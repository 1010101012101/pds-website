This set of Cassini spacecraft images shows a close-up view of two propeller
structures in Saturn's A ring. These images are part of a large view (see
[PIA10079](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10079)) that captures
eight new propeller-like features in what may be the propeller "hot zone" of
Saturn's rings.

Propellers were first discovered in Cassini images taken during Saturn orbit
insertion in 2004. Propellers form around small moonlets that are not massive
enough to clear out ring material, but are still able to push the ring
particles into a shape reminiscent of an airplane propeller.

These pictures show two new propellers close up (one centered on each image).
These images were put together from images in the Planetary Data System, a web
site which archives and distributes scientific data from NASA planetary
missions. The image on the top shows a propeller induced by a 150-meter
(490-foot) moonlet (See
[PIA10079](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10079) for a global
view; with this close up marked with a red box). Smaller bright spots in the
image are artifacts. The image on the bottom shows another propeller located
just outside of the Encke Gap. Fine horizontal stripes seen in the image are
wakes induced by the moon Pan.

In the top clear-filter image, taken during a stellar occultation on Aug. 20,
2005, the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera observed the unlit side of
the rings, with a phase angle of 126 degrees. The images were taken at 1
minute intervals with 0.05 seconds exposure time. Image resolution is 1
kilometer (0.6 miles) per pixel. The bottom clear-filter image was taken few
hours later with 2 seconds exposure time. Image resolution is 1.5 kilometer (1
mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
