Seen here is the end result of the process that occurs every time the moon
Prometheus closely approaches Saturn's F ring. The moon cuts a dark channel in
the ring's inner edge that then shears out over successive orbits, giving the
inner edge of the ring the grooved appearance seen here.

This process is described in detail, along with a movie of Prometheus creating
one of the streamer/channel features, in
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

The view is toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 3 degrees below the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 25, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
624,000 kilometers (388,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-ring-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 23 degrees. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
