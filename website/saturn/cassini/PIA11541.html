The shadow of the moon Mimas is seen through the unlit side of the Cassini
Division of Saturn's rings.

As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox, the planet's moons cast shadows
onto the rings. To learn more about this special time and to see a movie of a
moon's shadow moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

To watch a movie of Mimas' shadow moving across the unlit side of the rings,
see [PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 53
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 1, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 94 degrees. Image
scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
