**Caption:**

The shadow of the moon Mimas is seen through the unlit side of the Cassini
Division of Saturn's rings.

As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox, the planet's moons cast
shadows onto the rings. To learn more about this special time and to see a
movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html).

To watch a movie of Mimas' shadow moving across the unlit side of the
rings, see [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 53
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 1, 2009. The view was
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1
million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 94 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
