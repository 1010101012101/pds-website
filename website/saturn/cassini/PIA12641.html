The Cassini spacecraft looks toward the limb of Saturn and, on the right of
this image, views part of the rings through the planet's atmosphere.

Saturn's atmosphere can distort the view of the rings from some angles. See
[PIA07521](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07521) to learn more.
This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 24, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 85 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
