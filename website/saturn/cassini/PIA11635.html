**Caption:**

The bright arc within Saturn's G ring is shown truncated by the shadow of
the planet at the bottom of this image.

Although it can't be seen here, the tiny moonlet Aegaeon (formerly known
as S/2008 S 1) orbits within the bright arc. See [PIA11148](PIA11148.html) to learn more.
This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 4
degrees above the ringplane. Many background stars are visible elongated
by the motion of the spacecraft during the image's exposure.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 9, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 12 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
