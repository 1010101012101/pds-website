**Caption:**

Cassini coasts beneath giant Saturn, staring upward at its gleaming 
crescent and icy rings.

A great bull's-eye pattern is centered on the south pole, where a vast, 
hurricane-like storm spins.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 26 degrees 
below the ring plane. The view was acquired about two hours prior to 
[PIA08347](PIA08347.html).

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural-color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 30, 2007, at a distance of 
approximately 1.1 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 61 kilometers (38 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
