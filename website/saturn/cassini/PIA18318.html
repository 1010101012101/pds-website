The two large craters on Tethys, near the line where day fades to night,
almost resemble two giant eyes observing Saturn.

The location of these craters on Tethys' terminator throws their topography
into sharp relief. Both are large craters, but the larger and southernmost of
the two shows a more complex structure. The angle of the lighting highlights a
central peak in this crater. Central peaks are the result of the surface
reacting to the violent post-impact excavation of the crater. The northern
crater does not show a similar feature. Possibly the impact was too small to
form a central peak, or the composition of the material in the immediate
vicinity couldn't support the formation of a central peak.

In this image Tethys is significantly closer to the camera, while the planet
is in the background. Yet the moon is still utterly dwarfed by the giant
Saturn.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Tethys. North on Tethys is up
and rotated 42 degrees to the right. The image was taken in visible light with
the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 11, 2015.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 75,000 miles (120,000
kilometers) from Tethys. Image scale at Tethys is 4 miles (7 kilometers) per
pixel.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
