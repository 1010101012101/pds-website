The Cassini spacecraft looks past Saturn's rings and small moon Janus to spy
the planet's second largest moon, Rhea.

Janus is closest to Cassini here. The rings are between Janus (179 kilometers,
or 111 miles across) and Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across). Lit
terrain seen on Rhea is on the leading hemisphere of that moon. This view
looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on May 11, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 3 million kilometers (2 million miles) from Rhea and
approximately 2.4 million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Janus. Image
scale is 18 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel on Rhea. Image scale is 14
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on Janus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
