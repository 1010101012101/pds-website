The Cassini spacecraft views Saturn with a selection of its moons in varying
sizes.

Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is in the center of the image. Titan is 5,150
kilometers, or 3,200 miles, across. The smaller moon Enceladus (504
kilometers, or 313 miles across) is on the far right, appearing just below the
rings. The tiny moon Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) is barely
detectable as a speck on the far left, beyond the thin F ring. To enhance
visibility, Pandora has been brightened by a factor of two relative to the
rest of the image.

This view looks toward anti-Saturn side of Titan and toward the northern,
sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 15,
2011 using a combination of polarized and spectral filters sensitive to
wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 844,000 kilometers (524,000 miles)
from Titan and at a Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 78 degrees. Image
scale is 50 kilometers (31 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
