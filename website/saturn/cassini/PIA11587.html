**Caption:**

Saturn's B ring shows off bright spokes in the middle of this image taken 
at high phase.

This image was captured at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 119 
degrees. To learn more about these ghostly radial markings, see [PIA10567](PIA10567.html) and 
[PIA11144](PIA11144.html).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 
10 degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with 
the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 20, 2009. The view was 
acquired at a distance of approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 
million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
