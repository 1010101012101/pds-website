Saturn's B ring shows off bright spokes in the middle of this image taken at
high phase.

This image was captured at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 119
degrees. To learn more about these ghostly radial markings, see
[PIA10567](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10567) and
[PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 10
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 20, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
