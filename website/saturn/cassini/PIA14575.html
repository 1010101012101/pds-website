Saturn's rings lie in the distance as the Cassini spacecraft looks toward
Titan and its dark region called Shangri-La, east of the landing site of the
Huygens Probe.

See [PIA06136](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06136) and
[PIA07565](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07565) to learn more.

The moon's north polar hood is also visible here. See
[PIA09739](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09739) and
[PIA08137](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08137) to learn more
about Titan's atmosphere.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Titan (5,150 kilometers, or
3,200 miles across). North on Titan is up. This view looks toward the
northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 9,
2011 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 938 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) from Titan and at a Sun-
Titan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 35 degrees. Image scale is 8 kilometers
(5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
