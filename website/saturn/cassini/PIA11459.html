The Cassini spacecraft reveals a remarkable amount of structure in the outer
portion of Saturn's A ring.

The granular look of the outer edge of the A ring, first discovered soon after
Cassini's orbit insertion, is likely created by gravitational clumping of
particles there. As ring particles round the planet in their orbits in this
region, they also become perturbed by the gravitational forcing of Saturn's
two moons, Janus and Epimetheus. The resulting gravitational resonance at the
A ring's outer edge periodically forces the particles close together,
promoting clumping (see
[PIA09892](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09892)). Similar
clumping is seen at the outer edge of the B ring where a resonance with Mimas
has a similar effect on the ring particle orbits (see
[PIA10421](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10421)).

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 206,000 kilometers
(128,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
108 degrees. This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 64
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 2, 2008. Image scale is 901
meters (2,960 feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
