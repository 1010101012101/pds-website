**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft reveals a remarkable amount of structure in the 
outer portion of Saturn's A ring.

The granular look of the outer edge of the A ring, first discovered soon 
after Cassini's orbit insertion, is likely created by gravitational 
clumping of particles there. As ring particles round the planet in their 
orbits in this region, they also become perturbed by the gravitational 
forcing of Saturn's two moons, Janus and Epimetheus. The resulting 
gravitational resonance at the A ring's outer edge periodically forces the 
particles close together, promoting clumping (see [PIA09892](PIA09892.html)). Similar clumping 
is seen at the outer edge of the B ring where a resonance with Mimas has a 
similar effect on the ring particle orbits (see [PIA10421](PIA10421.html)).

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 206,000 kilometers 
(128,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, 
angle of 108 degrees. This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings 
from about 64 degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible 
light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 2, 2008. 
Image scale is 901 meters (2,960 feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
