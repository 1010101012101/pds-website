Two masters of their craft are caught at work shaping Saturn's rings. Pandora
(upper right) sculpts the F ring, as does nearby Prometheus (not seen in this
image). Meanwhile, Daphnis is busy holding open the Keeler gap (bottom
center), its presence revealed here by the waves it raises on the gap's edge.
The faint moon is located where the inner and outer waves appear to meet. Also
captured in this image, shining through the F ring above the image center, is
a single star.

Although gravity is by its very nature an attractive force, moons can interact
with ring particles in such a way that they effectively push ring particles
away from themselves. Ring particles experience tiny gravitational "kicks"
from these moons and subsequently collide with other ring particles, losing
orbital momentum. The net effect is for moons like Pandora (50 miles or 81
kilometers across) and Daphnis (5 miles or 8 kilometers across) to push ring
edges away from themselves. The Keeler gap is the result of just such an
interaction.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 50
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 30, 2013.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
