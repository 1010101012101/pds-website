The moon Prometheus slowly collides with the diffuse inner edge of Saturn's F
ring in this movie sequence of Cassini images. The oblong moon pulls a
streamer of material from the ring and leaves behind a dark channel.

Once during its 14.7-hour orbit of Saturn, Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63
miles across) reaches the point in its elliptical path, called apoapse, where
it is farthest away from Saturn and closest to the F ring. At this point,
Prometheus' gravity is just strong enough to draw a "streamer" of material out
of the core region of the F ring.

Initially the dust-sized material drawn away from the ring appears to form a
streamer pointing ahead of Prometheus in its orbit. (All orbital motion is
towards the right in the movie.) Over time, the streamer falls increasingly
farther behind Prometheus because material in the F ring is orbiting slower
than the moon. The streamer gets longer and a darker "channel" starts to be
seen (to the left of the streamer in the movie).

The creation of such streamers and channels occurs in a cycle that repeats
each Prometheus orbit: when Prometheus again reaches apoapse, it draws another
streamer of material from the F ring. But since Prometheus orbits faster than
the material in the ring, this new streamer is pulled from a different
location in the ring about 3.2 degrees (in longitude) ahead of the previous
one.

In this way, a whole series of streamer-channels is created along the F ring.
In some observations, 10 to 15 streamer-channels can easily be seen in the F
ring at one time (see
[PIA07712](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07712)). Eventually, a
streamer-channel disappears as shearing forces (i.e., Keplerian shear) act to
disperse the constituent dust particles.

The movie shows just under half of a complete streamer-channel cycle. The dark
frames in the movie represent the period during which Prometheus and the F
ring pass through Saturn's shadow.

The images in the movie were acquired by the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 23 and 24, 2006. The movie sequence consists of 72 clear
spectral filter images taken every 10.5 minutes over a period of about 12.5
hours.

The original images were cropped to show only the region around Prometheus and
the nearby portion of the F ring. The movie covers the region between 138,000
and 142,000 kilometers (86,000 and 88,000 miles) radially from Saturn and 1
degree in longitude from Prometheus on each side. Each frame was reprojected
such that the vertical axis represents distance from Saturn and the horizontal
axis represents longitude around Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel in the vertical direction; the images cover 0.005 degrees of
longitude in the horizontal direction. Because of the reprojection, the F ring
appears straight, rather than slightly curved, as it otherwise would.

Since the F ring has an elliptical shape, its radial distance from Saturn
varies by about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) around the ring. This accounts
for the apparent vertical movement of the ring over the course of the movie.
Only a very small part of the ring appears in each of the reprojected frames,
so the difference in the ring's radial distance from left to right across any
single frame is small enough as to be effectively unnoticeable.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
