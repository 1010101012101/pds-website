**Caption:**

The shepherd moon, Pandora, is seen here alongside the narrow F ring that 
it helps maintain. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

Cassini obtained this view from about four degrees above the ringplane. 
Captured here are several faint, dusty ringlets in the vicinity of the F 
ring core. The ringlets do not appear to be perturbed to the degree seen 
in the core.

The appearance of Pandora here is exciting, as the moon's complete shape 
can be seen, thanks to reflected light from Saturn, which illuminates 
Pandora's dark side. The hint of a crater is visible on the dark side of 
the moon.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on May 4, 2005, at a distance of approximately 
967,000 kilometers (601,000 miles) from Pandora and at a 
Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 117 degrees. The image scale 
is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
