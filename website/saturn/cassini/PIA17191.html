This collage, consisting of two Cassini images of long, sinuous, tendril-like
features from Saturn's moon Enceladus and two corresponding computer
simulations of the same features, illustrates how well the structures, and the
sizes of the particles composing them, can be modeled by tracing the
trajectories of tiny, icy grains ejected from Enceladus' south polar geysers.

The figures labeled "a" and "c" (see annotated image above) are computer-
enhanced images of the tendril structures near Enceladus that were taken at
high solar phase angle (174 and 170 degrees, respectively); figures "b" and
"d" are synthetic (computer-generated) images produced by following the
trajectories of tiny, icy particles ejected from the 36 most active geysers
(representing the top 50 percent of the moon's total geysering activity) found
on the south polar terrain. The match between real and synthetic images is
quite good and strongly supports the suggestion that tendrils are produced by
the moon's geysers.

Electromagnetic effects associated with electrical charges that collect on
small grains embedded in a magnetosphere like Saturn's can modify the grains'
trajectories. These effects are very sensitive to particle size, with smaller
particles feeling the effects of charging more strongly than larger ones. The
scale of the arc-like structures seen in the tendrils allows scientists to
determine that the tendril particles are no smaller than about 0.5 microns (a
micron is one millionth of a meter), a size consistent with that of E-ring
particles found from other Cassini observations, both imaging and in situ.

Figure "a" is from the observation of 2006; "c" was taken on July 19, 2013
during Cassini's Earth-imaging event (see
[PIA17172](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17172)). Orbital motion
is counter-clockwise in all images.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
