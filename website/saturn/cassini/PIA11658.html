**Caption:**

Mimas' shadow traverses the sunlit side of Saturn's rings in this movie 
and mosaic showcasing the unusual sights seen at Saturn as the planet 
approaches its August 2009 equinox.

The novel illumination geometry created as the Saturnian system approaches 
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial 
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only 
during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only 
once in about 15 Earth years.

Twenty images, each taken 3 minutes and 36 seconds apart, were combined to 
create this mosaic and movie. Contiguous images were stitched together to 
create the mosaic showing the whole swath of the rings across which the 
moon's shadow passed. 

At the beginning of the movie, the shadow starts on the bright B ring. It 
crosses the darker Cassini Division and then moves to the A ring. At the 
end of the movie, the edge of the shadow just catches the edge of the A 
ring next to blackness of the Roche Division separating the A ring from 
the thin F ring.

These images have been processed, and background stars have been removed. 
To see a movie and mosaic of Mimas' shadow moving across the unlit side of 
the rings, see [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 32 degrees 
below the ringplane. The images were taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 9, 2009. The view was 
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 55 
degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
