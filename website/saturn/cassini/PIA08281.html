**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks through the dense B ring toward a distant
star in an image from a recent stellar occultation observation. These
observations point the camera toward a star whose brightness is well
known. Then, as Cassini watches the rings pass in front, the star's light
fluctuates, providing information about the concentrations of ring
particles within the various radial features in the rings.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 35 degrees
above the ringplane. The star's image is partly saturated, causing the
vertical lines that extend up and down.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 26, 2006 at a distance of approximately
543,000 kilometers (338,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 106 degrees. Image scale is
about 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
