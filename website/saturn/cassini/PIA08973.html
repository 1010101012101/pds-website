Cassini looks toward northern latitudes on Saturn and out across the
ringplane. This infrared view probes clouds beneath the hazes that obscure the
planet's depths in natural color views.

This image looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 24
degrees above the ringplane. The rings' shadow drapes across the region north
of the planet's bright equatorial band.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a
spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of light centered at 890 nanometers.
The view was acquired on May 24, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.5
million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 89 kilometers
(55 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
