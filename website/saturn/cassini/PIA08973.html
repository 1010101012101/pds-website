**Caption:**

Cassini looks toward northern latitudes on Saturn and out across the 
ringplane. This infrared view probes clouds beneath the hazes that obscure 
the planet's depths in natural color views.

This image looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 24 
degrees above the ringplane. The rings' shadow drapes across the region 
north of the planet's bright equatorial band.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a 
spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of light centered at 890 
nanometers. The view was acquired on May 24, 2007 at a distance of 
approximately 1.5 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 89 kilometers (55 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
