The Cassini spacecraft trades recent views of dark spokes in Saturn's B ring
for the bright spokes seen here.

In the viewing geometry in which Cassini is looking approximately in the
direction of the sun (called high phase), the spokes appear white against the
rings because the very small particles comprising the spokes preferentially
scatter light forward (in this case, toward Cassini).

Dark spokes can be seen in images captured at low phase angles earlier in
2008\. (See [PIA11114](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11114).)

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 21 degrees
below the ringplane and was obtained at a distance of approximately 563,000
kilometers (350,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 151 degrees. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 26, 2008\. Image scale is 60
kilometers (37 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
