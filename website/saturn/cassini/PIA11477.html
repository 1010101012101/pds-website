**Caption:**

The moon Prometheus is seen here in its never-ending perturbation of 
Saturn's F ring.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) periodically gores the F 
ring, drawing out streamers of material from the ring. For a movie showing 
this process, see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 64 degrees 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 12, 2009. The view was obtained at 
a distance of approximately 950,000 kilometers (590,000 miles) from Saturn 
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 93 degrees. Image scale 
is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
