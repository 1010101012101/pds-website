**Caption:**

From just outside the faint edge of Saturn's F ring, the moon Pandora
keeps watch over her fine-grained flock. The outer flanks of the F ring
region are populated by ice particles approaching the size of the
particles comprising smoke. As a shepherd moon, Pandora helps her cohort
Prometheus confine and shape the main F ring. Pandora is 84 kilometers
(52 miles) across.

Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) wide and orbits interior to the F
ring.

The small knot seen attached to the core is one of several that Cassini
scientists are eyeing as they attempt to distinguish embedded moons from
transient clumps of material (see [PIA07716](PIA07716.html)).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Aug. 2, 2005, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 930 nanometers at a distance of approximately 610,000
kilometers (379,000 miles) from Pandora and at a Sun-Pandora-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 146 degrees. Image scale is 4 kilometers (2 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
