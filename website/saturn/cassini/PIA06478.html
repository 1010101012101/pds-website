**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Mimas hangs in the sky above Saturn's rings in this Cassini 
spacecraft narrow angle camera image from Aug. 3, 2004. Saturn's shadow 
stretches across the rings at bottom right, while several bright clumps 
in the F ring orbit the planet. Mimas is 398 kilometers (247 miles) wide.

The image was taken in visible light with the narrow angle camera at a 
distance of 8 million kilometers (5 million miles) from Saturn. The image 
scale is 48 kilometers (30 miles) per pixel. Contrast was slightly 
enhanced to aid visibility. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
