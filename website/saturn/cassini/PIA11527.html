**Caption:**

Prometheus is seen near Saturn's tenuous F ring as the moon orbits in the
Roche Division, between the F and A rings.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles
across) periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See
[PIA10461](PIA10461.html) and [PIA10593](PIA10593.html) to learn more. To watch a movie of this process,
see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html). A dark channel from an
earlier encounter can be seen in the F ring at the top of the image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 2, 2009. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (932,000
miles) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 108 degrees. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
