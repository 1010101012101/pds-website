**Caption:**

Bright clouds twist and twirl in the fast-moving and turbulent winds in
the Saturnian north. Hints of organized jets can also be seen.

This view is centered on a region 24 degrees north of Saturn's equator.
Shadows cast by the rings cover the bottom of this scene.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Aug. 13, 2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared
light centered at 750 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 4.1 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 24 kilometers (15 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
