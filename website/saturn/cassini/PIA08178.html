**Caption:**

Janus and Epimetheus continue to separate, following their orbital swap in 
January 2006. Until 2010, Janus will remain the innermost of the pair, 
whose orbits around Saturn are separated by only about 50 kilometers (31 
miles) on average.

Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across) appears just right of the 
bright A ring ansa, or edge, while Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles 
across) is seen near upper right. (See [PIA08170](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08170) for a closer view of 
these dancing moons.)

The faint F ring extends across the image; Janus appears directly between 
its near and far edges.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on April 16, 2006, at a distance of approximately 3.7 
million kilometers (2.3 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 22 
kilometers (14 miles) per pixel on Janus and Epimetheus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
