Saturn's density is so low, and its rotation is so fast, that the planet
bulges around its waistline as is spins.

Saturn is nearly 12,000 kilometers (7,500 miles) wider at its equator than at
its poles, and its oblateness is clearly visible in this view.

The view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 2 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 2, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.9 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 109
kilometers (68 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
