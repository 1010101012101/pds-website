**Caption:**

As it completed its first orbit of Saturn, Cassini zoomed in on the rings 
to catch this wondrous view of the shepherd moon Prometheus (102 
kilometers, or 63 miles across) working its influence on the 
multi-stranded and kinked F ring.

The F ring resolves into five separate strands in this closeup view. 
Potato-shaped Prometheus is seen here, connected to the ringlets by a 
faint strand of material. Imaging scientists are not sure exactly how 
Prometheus is interacting with the F ring here, but they have speculated 
that the moon might be gravitationally pulling material away from the 
ring. The ringlets are disturbed in several other places. In some, 
discontinuities or "kinks" in the ringlets are seen; in others, gaps in 
the diffuse inner strands are seen. All these features appear to be due 
to the influence of Prometheus.

The image was taken in visible light with the narrow angle camera on Oct. 
29, 2004, at a distance of about 782,000 kilometers (486,000 miles) from 
Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 147 
degrees. The image scale is 4.7 kilometers (2.9 miles) per pixel. The 
image has been magnified by a factor of two, and contrast was enhanced, 
to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
