Saturn's B ring is spread out in all its glory in this image from Cassini.
Scientists are trying to better understand the origin and nature of the
various structures seen in the B ring.

Saturn's B ring is the densest and most massive of all the rings. The C ring
is also visible inside the B ring and the A ring puts on an appearance beyond
the Cassini Division near the top and bottom of the image.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 7 degrees above
the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 22, 2012.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 201,000 miles (324,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 134
degrees. Image scale is 10 miles (16 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
