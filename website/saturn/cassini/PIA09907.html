Looking upward from beneath the ringplane, the Cassini spacecraft spies
Saturn's "wave maker" and "flying saucer" moons.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across at its widest point) and its
gravitationally induced edge waves are seen at left within the Keeler Gap. The
equatorial bulge on Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across at its widest
point) is clearly visible here.

See [PIA06237](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06237) and
[PIA08405](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08405) for additional
images and information about these two moons.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 16 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 22, 2008. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 898,000 kilometers (558,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
