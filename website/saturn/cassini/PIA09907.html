**Caption:**

Looking upward from beneath the ringplane, the Cassini spacecraft spies
Saturn's "wave maker" and "flying saucer" moons.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across at its widest point) and its
gravitationally induced edge waves are seen at left within the Keeler Gap.
The equatorial bulge on Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across at its
widest point) is clearly visible here.

See [PIA06237](PIA06237.html) and [PIA08405](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08405) for additional images and information about
these two moons.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 16 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 22, 2008. The view was acquired at
a distance of approximately 898,000 kilometers (558,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is about 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
