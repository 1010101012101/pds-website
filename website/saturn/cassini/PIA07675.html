**Caption:**

A great storm swims in the cloud lanes of Saturn's high northern
latitudes. Dark bands across the bottom of this view are shadows cast by
the partly opaque rings. Cloud features are visible within the shadow of
the A ring, below center.

The image was taken in polarized infrared light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 8, 2005, at a distance of
approximately 3.2 million kilometers (2 million miles) from Saturn. The
image scale is 37 kilometers (23 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
