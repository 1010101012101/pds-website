A great storm swims in the cloud lanes of Saturn's high northern latitudes.
Dark bands across the bottom of this view are shadows cast by the partly
opaque rings. Cloud features are visible within the shadow of the A ring,
below center.

The image was taken in polarized infrared light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Dec. 8, 2005, at a distance of approximately 3.2
million kilometers (2 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 37
kilometers (23 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
