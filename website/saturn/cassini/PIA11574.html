**Caption:**

The shadow of the moon Janus dwarfs the shadow of Daphnis on Saturn's A 
ring in this image taken as the planet approached its August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) orbits in the A ring's Keeler 
Gap and, along with the moon's attending edge waves, can be seen casting a 
short shadow in the top left quadrant of the image. Equinox has exposed 
shadows cast by these edge waves, or vertical structures of ring material 
created by Daphnis' gravity (see [PIA11655](PIA11655.html)).

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) is not pictured here, but the 
moon's shadow stretches across the A ring from the center of the image to 
near the Encke Gap on the left of the image. The Cassini Division appears 
bright on the right of the image.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August 
2009 equinox allows out-of-plane structures and moons orbiting in or near 
the plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. 
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after 
Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn 
more about this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving 
across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html) and [PIA11660](PIA11660.html). 

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 27 
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on July 11, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of 
approximately 491,000 kilometers (305,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 26 degrees. Image scale is 26 
kilometers (16 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
