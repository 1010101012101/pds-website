This high-phase image from the Cassini spacecraft shows dark areas separating
faint spokes that are brighter than the rest of Saturn's B ring.

At a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 122 degrees, light is scattered
from the dusty spokes toward Cassini's cameras. See
[PIA10567](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10567) to learn more
about spokes. The shadow of Saturn cuts across the bottom of the image.
Several background stars are visible.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 39
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 24, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 887,000 kilometers (551,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 50 kilometers (31 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
