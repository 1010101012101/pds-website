**Caption:**

Saturn's F ring, which appears kinked and gored in many images, looks 
straight here. Above the brighter core, the ghostly strands of the F ring's 
outer envelope, which has a spiral arm structure, are visible.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 67 
degrees above the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Nov. 8, 2008 at a distance of 
approximately 622,000 kilometers (386,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 75 degrees. Image scale is 3 
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
