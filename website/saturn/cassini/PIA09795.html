**Caption:**

Just before Rhea slipped behind Saturn, the Cassini spacecraft captured
the moon in its disappearing act.

Along with the partly obscured Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles
across) are Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across), at right, and
Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across), left of Tethys.

At the wavelength in which this image was taken, absorption of sunlight by
methane gas in Saturn's atmosphere is strong, causing the planet to appear
darker than at other wavelengths.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 4
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 9, 2007 using a spectral filter
sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 890 nanometers. The
view was acquired at a distance of approximately 2.8 million kilometers
(1.7 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 44 degrees. Image scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
