**Caption:**

Saturn's rings cast a dramatic shadow separating the blues and greens of
the planet's northern hemisphere from the creamy pastels coloring the
southern hemisphere.

This mosaic combines 6 images&mdash;2 each of red, green and blue spectral
filters&mdash;to create this natural color view. The images were obtained
with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 30, 2008 at a
distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (750,000 miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 30 degrees.
Image scale is 67 kilometers (42 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
