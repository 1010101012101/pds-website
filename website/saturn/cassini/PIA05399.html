Saturn's southern hemisphere shows dark spots and wisps of high clouds in this
image. Note the boomerang shape of the patterns in the mid-latitude bands. The
image was taken with the Cassini narrow angle camera in the near infrared on
May 8, 2004, from a distance of 28.1million kilometers (17.5 million miles).
Image scale is 168 kilometers (104 miles) per pixel. The image has been
enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
