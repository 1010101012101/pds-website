**Caption:**

Saturn's southern hemisphere shows dark spots and wisps of high clouds in 
this image. Note the boomerang shape of the patterns in the mid-latitude 
bands. The image was taken with the Cassini narrow angle camera in the 
near infrared on May 8, 2004, from a distance of 28.1million kilometers 
(17.5 million miles). Image scale is 168 kilometers (104 miles) per 
pixel. The image has been enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
