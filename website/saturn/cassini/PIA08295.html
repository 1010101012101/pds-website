**Caption:**

The two prominent dark gaps in Saturn's A ring contain small embedded
moons and a host of other intriguing features.

Here, three unique ringlets are visible in the Encke gap (325 kilometers,
or 200 miles wide). The innermost ringlet (topmost here) is faint but
continuous. The center ringlet brightens substantially toward upper left
and displays a few slight kinks. This ringlet is coincident with the orbit
of Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across). The outermost ringlet is
discontinuous, with two bright regions visible.

The narrower Keeler gap (42 kilometers, or 26 miles wide) hosts the moon
Daphnis (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across, not in this image), which
raises waves in the gap edges as it orbits Saturn (see [PIA07809](PIA07809.html)).

At lower left, faint ringlets flanking the bright F ring core are visible.
These features were found by the Cassini spacecraft to be arranged into a
spiral arm structure that winds around the planet like a spring. The
spiral may be caused by tiny moonlets or clumps of material that have
smashed through the F ring core and liberated material.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 23 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 11, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.1
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 151 degrees. Image scale is
about 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
