**Caption:**

An icy moon drifts above the stormy skies of Saturn.

Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) is seen here before the
dark line of the rings. The shadows of the C ring and B ring drape the
northern hemisphere at top.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than
a degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Aug. 15, 2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared
light centered at 750 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 3.9 million kilometers (2.4 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is about 22 kilometers (17 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
