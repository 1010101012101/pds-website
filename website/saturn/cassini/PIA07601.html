**Caption:**

Prometheus poses here with its latest creation: a dark, diagonal gore in 
the tenuous material interior to Saturn's F ring. The shepherd moon 
creates a new gore each time it comes closest to the F ring in its orbit 
of Saturn, and the memory of previous passes is preserved in the rings's 
structure for some time afterward. Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) 
across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 20, 2005, at a distance of approximately 
499,000 kilometers (310,000 miles) from Saturn and at a high 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 144 degrees. Resolution in the 
original image was 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
