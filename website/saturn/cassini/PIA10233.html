For an Earth observer on May 3, 2005, the Cassini spacecraft appeared to pass
behind the rings, then Saturn, then the rings again (the red line). The
discovered harmonic structure was found on both the way in and out, but only
in locations where particles are densely packed together, such as the B ring
and the innermost part of the A ring.

The May 3 radio experiment and several others to follow in 2005 showed that
the regular spacing of the harmonic structure vary from 100 to 250 meters (320
to 820 feet), depending on the location in the rings. To see an illustration
of this occultation see

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radio science team
is based at JPL.
