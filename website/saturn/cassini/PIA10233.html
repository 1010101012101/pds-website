**Caption:**

For an Earth observer on May 3, 2005, the Cassini spacecraft appeared to 
pass behind the rings, then Saturn, then the rings again (the red line). 
The discovered harmonic structure was found on both the way in and out, 
but only in locations where particles are densely packed together, such as 
the B ring and the innermost part of the A ring. 

The May 3 radio experiment and several others to follow in 2005 showed 
that the regular spacing of the harmonic structure vary from 100 to 250 
meters (320 to 820 feet), depending on the location in the rings. To see 
an illustration of this occultation see [PIA10232](PIA10232.html).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radio 
science team is based at JPL.
