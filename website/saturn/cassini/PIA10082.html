"Staring Mittens"

This is an artist concept and movie of the view from Cassini during the star
occultation that detected "Mittens," the small object to the right of the
star. As Cassini watched the star pass behind Saturn's F ring (foreground),
the star blinked out when Mittens blocked it, indicating it may be a solid
moonlet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph was designed and built at, and the team is based at the
University of Colorado, Boulder.
