**Caption:**

This is an artist concept and movie of the view from Cassini during the
star occultation that detected "Mittens," the small object to the right of
the star. As Cassini watched the star pass behind Saturn's F ring
(foreground), the star blinked out when Mittens blocked it, indicating it
may be a solid moonlet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The
ultraviolet imaging spectrograph was designed and built at, and the team
is based at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
