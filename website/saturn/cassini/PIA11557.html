The Cassini spacecraft shows a section of Saturn and its rings which includes
a special treat made possible as the planet approaches its August 2009
equinox: the shadow of a moon cast on the rings.

The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 2009
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies
of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

The moon casting the shadow, Tethys, is not shown in the image. In the left-
most part of the top of the image, Saturn is overexposed where it is lit by
the sun. The rest of Saturn shown here is dimly lit by ringshine and light
scattered through the rings. See
[PIA09912](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09912) for an image of
Saturn under similar lighting.

Four background stars can be seen in the image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 52
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 15, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 89 degrees. Image
scale is 103 kilometers (64 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
