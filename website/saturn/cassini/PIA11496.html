Saturn's moon Daphnis creates waves of disturbance in the Keeler Gap in this
image of the wide A ring and narrow F ring.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is a small point of light in the
center of this image which shows the moon's gravity creating perturbations in
the material at the edges of the narrow Keeler gap. (See
[PIA07809](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07809) for a higher-
resolution image of this process.) Background stars appear as bright specks in
the wider Encke Gap of the A ring near the bottom of the image, and elsewhere
in the image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 60
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 30, 2009. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles)
from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 69 degrees.
Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
