**Caption:**

The bright, perturbed core of Saturn's F ring displays several kink-like
features. The core is flanked by dimmer, smoother ringlets.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 12
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Dec. 2, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 575,000 kilometers (357,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-ring-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 92 degrees. Image scale is 3
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
