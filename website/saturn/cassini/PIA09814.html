The bright, perturbed core of Saturn's F ring displays several kink-like
features. The core is flanked by dimmer, smoother ringlets.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 12
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Dec. 2, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
575,000 kilometers (357,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-ring-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 92 degrees. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
