**Caption:**

Stately Saturn sits surrounded by its darkened disk of ice. An increasing 
range of hues has become visible in the northern hemisphere as spring 
approaches and the ring shadows slide southward.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 17 
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue 
spectral filters were combined to create this natural color view. The 
images were acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on 
April 15, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers 
(906,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 84 kilometers (52 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
