Stately Saturn sits surrounded by its darkened disk of ice. An increasing
range of hues has become visible in the northern hemisphere as spring
approaches and the ring shadows slide southward.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 17
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were
acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 15, 2008 at a
distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (906,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 84 kilometers (52 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
