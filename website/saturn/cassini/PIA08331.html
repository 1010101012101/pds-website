**Caption:**

High-resolution Cassini images show an astonishing level of structure in
Saturn's Cassini Division, including two ringlets that were not seen in
NASA Voyager spacecraft images 25 years ago.

This view was taken with the sun almost directly behind Saturn and its
rings, a viewing geometry in which microscopic ring particles brighten
substantially. The image shows the diffuse new ringlet in the Cassini
Division as the brightest feature in that region.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 15, 2006, at a distance of approximately 2.2
million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. This view looks toward
the unlit side of the rings from about 15 degrees above the ringplane. The
phase angle, or sun-Saturn-spacecraft angle, was 179 degrees. Image scale
on the sky at the distance of Saturn is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
