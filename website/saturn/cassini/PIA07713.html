**Caption:**

A solitary clump-like feature in Saturn's F ring orbits past in this movie
sequence made from Cassini images. This feature is seen magnified at the
bottom right in [PIA07716](PIA07716.html).

Scientists are trying to determine whether these features are solid
moonlets that help control the ring or just loose clumps of particles
within the ring.

The images in this sequence were acquired in visible light using the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 13, 2005, at a distance
of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is about 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
