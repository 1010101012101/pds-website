**Caption:**

Saturn's rings cast threadlike shadows on the planet's northern
hemisphere. Note the translucent C ring, and thin outermost F ring. The
image was taken with the Cassini narrow angle camera in visible light on
May 10, 2004, at a distance of 27.2 million kilometers (16.9 million
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles) per pixel.
Contrast in the image was enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science,
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
