Saturn's brightly sunlit moon Rhea commands the foreground in this image from
Cassini. The planet's splendid rings are discernible in the background. Rhea
is 1,528 kilometers (949 miles) across.

The spacecraft was just above the ringplane when it acquired this image, and
thus captured the darkened appearance of the dense B ring when viewed with
sunlight filtered through the rings. From this perspective, bright areas in
the rings are regions of low density, containing very small particles that
effectively scatter light toward Cassini.

North on Rhea is up and rotated about 25 degrees to the left. This view shows
principally the anti-Saturn hemisphere on Rhea. The right side of Rhea is
overexposed.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 540,000 kilometers
(340,000 miles) from Rhea and at a Sun-Rhea-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 110
degrees. The image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
