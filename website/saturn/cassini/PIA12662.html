The shadow of the moon Enceladus darkens a small portion of the swirling
clouds on Saturn. Enceladus itself is not visible in this view.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane. The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 24, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 86 degrees. Image
scale is 98 kilometers (61 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
