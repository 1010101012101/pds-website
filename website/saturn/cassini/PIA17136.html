A single jet feature appears to leap from the F ring of Saturn in this image
from the Cassini spacecraft. A closer inspection suggests that in reality
there are a few smaller jets that make up this feature, suggesting a slightly
more complex origin process.

These "jets," like much of the dynamic and changing F ring, are believed by
scientists to be caused by the ring's particles interacting with small moons
orbiting nearby.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 45
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 20, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 870,000 miles (1.4
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 77 degrees. Image scale is 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
