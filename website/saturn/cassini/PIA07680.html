The Cassini spacecraft captured this glimpse of icy Epimetheus just before the
small moon disappeared behind the bulk of Saturn's atmosphere.

See [PIA07567](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07567) for a closer
view of Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Dec. 20, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3 million kilometers
(1.4 million miles) from Epimetheus and 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million
miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 14 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on
Epimetheus and 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
