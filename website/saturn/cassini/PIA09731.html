**Caption:**

The two moons pictured here each share their orbits with other bodies.

Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across, at left) has two much 
smaller "Trojan" moons, Helene and Polydeuces (not seen here), that orbit 
60 degrees in front of and behind it in its orbit. Epimetheus (116 
kilometers, or 72 miles across, at right) shares its orbital path with 
Janus, and the two moons swap positions every few years -- one moving just 
a bit closer to Saturn and the other moving slightly farther away.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than 
a degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on July 28, 2007. Cassini was approximately 2.9 
million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn when it acquired this 
view. Image scale is 15 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on Dione.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
