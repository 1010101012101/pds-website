The Cassini spacecraft focuses on a streamer-channel feature in Saturn's F
ring.

These features are created by the moon Prometheus as it closely approaches the
ring once per orbit (see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397)).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 36
degrees above the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 30, 2008. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 970,000 kilometers (602,000 miles)
from Saturn and at a Sun-ring-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 45 degrees. Image
scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
