Saturn's bright equatorial band displays an exquisite swirl near the planet's
eastern limb. This image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft's narrow angle
camera on May 18, 2004, from a distance of 23.4 million kilometers (14.5
million miles) from Saturn. The camera used a filter sensitive to absorption
and scattering of sunlight by methane gas in the infrared (centered at 889
nanometers). The image scale is 139 kilometers (86 miles) per pixel. No
contrast enhancement has been performed on this image.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
