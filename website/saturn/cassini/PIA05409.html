**Caption:**

Saturn's bright equatorial band displays an exquisite swirl near the 
planet's eastern limb. This image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft's 
narrow angle camera on May 18, 2004, from a distance of 23.4 million 
kilometers (14.5 million miles) from Saturn. The camera used a filter 
sensitive to absorption and scattering of sunlight by methane gas in the 
infrared (centered at 889 nanometers). The image scale is 139 kilometers 
(86 miles) per pixel. No contrast enhancement has been performed on this 
image.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
