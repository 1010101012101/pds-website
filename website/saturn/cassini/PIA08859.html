**Caption:**

From on high, the Cassini spacecraft spots a group of faint spokes against 
the striped landscape of the B ring, the dark region in the middle of the 
rings here. The spokes appear as irregular blotches, bright against the 
unlit side of the rings.

Outside the rings, at about the two o'clock position in the image, is the 
moon Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across). The two points of light 
below center, on both sides of the F ring, are not the shepherd moons 
Prometheus and Pandora, but rather, are stars in the background. Other 
faint stars are also visible in the image.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 46 degrees 
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Dec. 20, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.9 
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 144 degrees. Image scale is 109 
kilometers (68 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
