A trio of icy moons crowds together along the Cassini spacecraft's line of
sight.

Brilliant Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) sits on the planet's
shadow-draped limb at center; Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across at
its widest point) is a bright speck hovering near the rings; and Mimas (396
kilometers, or 246 miles across) is seen at lower right.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about a degree below
the ringplane. The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 28, 2007. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 291,000 kilometers (181,000 miles) from Enceladus.
Scale in the image ranges from 17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel on Enceladus
to 32 kilometers (20 miles) per pixel on Saturn, in the background.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
