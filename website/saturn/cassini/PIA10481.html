**Caption:**

A trio of icy moons crowds together along the Cassini spacecraft's line of 
sight.

Brilliant Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) sits on the 
planet's shadow-draped limb at center; Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles 
across at its widest point) is a bright speck hovering near the rings; and 
Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles across) is seen at lower right.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about a degree 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible green light with the 
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 28, 2007. The view was 
obtained at a distance of approximately 291,000 kilometers (181,000 miles) 
from Enceladus. Scale in the image ranges from 17 kilometers (11 miles) 
per pixel on Enceladus to 32 kilometers (20 miles) per pixel on Saturn, in 
the background.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
