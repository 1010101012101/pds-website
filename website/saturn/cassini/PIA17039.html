This set of images from NASA's Cassini mission shows the difference in the
amount of spray emanating from Saturn's moon Enceladus. The images from
Cassini's visual and infrared mapping spectrometer show that Enceladus sprays
the most when it is farthest away from Saturn in its orbit (left) and sprays
the least when it is closest to Saturn (right).

Water ice and organic particles gush out of fissures known as "tiger stripes"
at Enceladus' south pole. Scientists think the fissures are squeezed shut when
the moon is feeling the greatest force of Saturn's gravity. They theorize the
reduction of that gravity allows the fissures to open and release the jets.

Scientists correlate the brightness of the Enceladus plume to the amount of
solid material being ejected because the fine grains of water ice in the plume
are very bright when lit from behind. Between the dimmest and brightest
images, they detected a change of about three to four times in brightness,
approximately the same as moving from a dim hallway to a brightly lit office.

This analysis is the first clear finding that shows the jets at Enceladus vary
in a predictable manner. The image on the left was obtained on Oct. 1, 2011.
The image on the right was obtained on Jan. 30, 2011.

A related image,
[PIA17040](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17040), shows where
these different brightness levels were detected in Saturn's orbit.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, DC. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The visual and infrared
mapping spectrometer was built by JPL, with a major contribution by the
Italian Space Agency. The visual and infrared mapping spectrometer science
team is based at the University of Arizona, Tucson.
