Tiny Daphnis' impact on the Keeler gap in which it resides can be seen in this
image from the Cassini spacecraft.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or5 miles across) makes waves in the edge of the Keeler
gap as it orbits.
[PIA09812](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09812) shows Daphnis
and Pan, another shepherding moon, creating their perturbations on the rings.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 40
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 11, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (627,000 miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 44 degrees. Image
scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
