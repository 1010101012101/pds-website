**Caption:**

Ring material, pulled to spectacular heights above the ring plane by the 
gravity of the moon Daphnis, casts long shadows on Saturn's A ring in this 
Cassini image taken about a month before the planet's August 2009 equinox.

The shadows in this image have lengths as long as 500 kilometers (310 
miles), meaning the structures casting the shadows reach heights of almost 
4 kilometers (2.5 miles) above the ring plane. These heights are much 
greater than those previously observed for the Daphnis edge waves (see 
[PIA11654](PIA11654.html)), and are very likely caused by the 
distance between Daphnis and the inner edge of its gap getting unusually 
small at certain times.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles, across) is a bright dot in the Keeler 
Gap of the A ring on the right of the image. The moon has an inclined 
orbit, and its gravitational pull perturbs the orbits of the particles of 
the A ring forming the Keeler Gap's edge and sculpts the edge into waves 
having both horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components. Material on 
the inner edge of the gap orbits faster than the moon so that the waves 
there lead the moon in its orbit. Material on the outer edge moves slower 
than the moon, so waves there trail the moon. See [PIA11655](PIA11655.html) to learn 
more and to see a movie of this process.

The thin F ring on the left of the image shows the perturbations caused by 
the moon Prometheus. See [PIA08397](PIA08397.html) to learn 
more.

This image and others like it are only possible around the time of 
Saturn's equinox which occurs every half-Saturn-year (equivalent to about 
15 Earth years). The illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers 
the sun's angle to the ring plane, significantly darkens the rings, and 
causes out-of-plane structures to cast long shadows across the rings. 
Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of 
Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also 
the shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see [PIA11664](PIA11664.html)).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 42 
degrees above the ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on July 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from Saturn and at 
a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 84 degrees. Image scale is 9 
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages  
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The  
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and  
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space  
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
