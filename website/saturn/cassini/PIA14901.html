These two natural color views taken 11 hours -- one Saturn day -- apart by
NASA's Cassini spacecraft help scientists measure wind speeds in the huge
storm seen here in the planet's northern hemisphere.

The view on the left is earlier than the view on the right. Scientists use
these time-lapse images to track specific, small and sometimes subtle features
in the clouds. The smallest features visible in the image are the most useful.
However, tracking the clouds in this storm is difficult because the features
don't always last one Saturn day.

See [PIA14903](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14903) and
[PIA14905](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14905) to learn more
about the size and development of this storm.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create these natural color views.

The images for the view on the left were acquired with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Feb. 23, 2011, at a distance of approximately 1.1 million
miles (1.8 million kilometers) from Saturn. The images for the view on the
right were acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 24,
2011, at a distance of approximately 1.2 million miles (1.9 million
kilometers) from Saturn.

Image scale is 64 miles (104 kilometers) per pixel in both views.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
