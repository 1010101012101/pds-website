**Caption:**

The moon Prometheus casts a shadow on Saturn's F ring near a
streamer-channel it has created on the ring. The image was taken as the
planet approached its August 2009 equinox.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) and Atlas (30 kilometers,
or 19 miles across) both orbit in the Roche Division between the A ring
and the thin F ring. Atlas is the smaller moon to the lower left of
Prometheus in the image. Other small, bright specks are background stars.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus periodically creates
streamer-channels in the F ring. To learn more and to watch a movie of
this process, see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html).

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's
equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible
only during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs
only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time
and to see movies of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html)
and [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 47
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 30, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 1.9 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Atlas and
at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 88 degrees. Image scale is
11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
