Saturn's moon Pandora shares the stage with ghostly B ring spokes in this
Cassini spacecraft scene.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) is on the left. The spokes are the
radial markings visible on the right of the image. See
[PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144) and
[PIA08288](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08288) to learn more.

The image was taken using a compression scheme that reduces the image file
size on the spacecraft's data recorder, resulting in the rings' slightly
pixelated appearance. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the
rings from about 9 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Jan. 11, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
630,000 kilometers (391,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 51 degrees. Image scale is 34 kilometers (21 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
