**Caption:**

Prometheus dips into the inner F ring at its farthest point from Saturn in
its orbit, creating a dark gore and a corresponding bright streamer. Gores
created during previous apoapsis (the name for the farthest point in an
orbit) passes, are seen above. The older gores are farther behind the moon
in its orbit of Saturn.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 31 degrees
above the ringplane. Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 1, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.7
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 162 degrees. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
