**Caption:**

Cassini's celestial sleuthing has paid off with this time-lapse series of 
images which confirmed earlier suspicions that a small moon was orbiting 
within the narrow Keeler gap of Saturn's rings.

The movie sequence, which consists of 12 images taken over 16 minutes 
while Cassini gazed down upon the sunlit side of the A ring, shows a tiny 
moon orbiting in the center of the Keeler gap, churning up waves in the 
gap edges as it goes. The pattern of waves travels with the moon in 
its orbit.

The Keeler gap is located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) inside the 
outer edge of the A ring, which is also the outer edge of the bright main 
rings. The new object is about 7 kilometers across (4 miles) and reflects 
about 50 percent of the sunlight that falls upon it -- a brightness that 
is typical of particles in the nearby rings.

The new body has been provisionally named S/2005 S1.

Imaging scientists predicted the moon's presence and its orbital distance 
from Saturn after July 2004, when they saw a set of peculiar spiky and 
wispy features in the Keeler gap's outer edge. The similarities of the 
Keeler gap features to those noted in Saturn's F ring and the Encke gap 
led the scientists to conclude that a small body, a few kilometers across, 
was lurking in the center of the Keeler gap, awaiting discovery.

Also included here is a view of the same scene created by combining six 
individual, unmagnified frames used in the movie sequence. This digital 
composite view improves the overall resolution of the scene compared to 
that available in any of the single images.

The images in this movie sequence were obtained with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 1, 2005, at a distance of 
approximately 1.1 million kilometers (708,000 miles) from Saturn. 
Resolution in the original image was 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel. 
The images in the movie sequence have been magnified in (the vertical 
direction only) by a factor of two to aid visibility of features caused 
within the gap by the moonlet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
