**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft spies two of the small, irregular moons that patrol 
the outer edges of Saturn's main rings.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) hugs the interior of the F 
ring right of center, while Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) 
hangs in the foreground below center. Hints of craters can be seen on 
Janus.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than 
a degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on June 14, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.6 
million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about 10 
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
