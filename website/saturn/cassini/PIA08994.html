The Cassini spacecraft spies two of the small, irregular moons that patrol the
outer edges of Saturn's main rings.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) hugs the interior of the F
ring right of center, while Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) hangs
in the foreground below center. Hints of craters can be seen on Janus.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a
degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 14, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers
(1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about 10 kilometers (6 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
