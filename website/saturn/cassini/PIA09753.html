**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft snapped this Saturn portrait from the distance of 
Iapetus, just before beginning its close encounter with the two-toned moon.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) is visible against the 
clouds of the northern hemisphere. Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles 
across) stands out as a bright speck against the dark ring shadows, near 
center.

Enceladus is not pictured here, although it casts its shadow upon the 
northern hemisphere, to the left of Rhea.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees 
below the ringplane. The rings disappear into the planet's shadow at 
right.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Sept. 9, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of 
approximately 3.3 million kilometers (2.1 million miles) from Saturn. 
Image scale is 195 kilometers (121 miles) per pixel on the planet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
