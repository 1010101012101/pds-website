**Caption:**

Bright undulations disturb a faint ringlet drifting through the center of
the Encke Gap. This ring structure shares the orbit of the moon Pan.

A second, fainter ringlet is visible below the central ringlet.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 44 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Dec. 14, 2006 at a distance of approximately
462,000 kilometers (287,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 2
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
