This spectacular image shows Prometheus (at left) and Pandora (at right), with
their flock of icy ring particles (the F ring) between them. Pandora is
exterior to the ring, and closer to the spacecraft here. Each of the shepherd
satellites has an unusual shape, with a few craters clearly visible.

The effect of Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) on the F ring is
visible as it pulls material out of the ring when it is farthest from Saturn
in its orbit. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

The image was taken in polarized green light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 29, 2005, at a distance of approximately 459,000
kilometers (285,000 miles) from Pandora and 483,500 kilometers (300,500 miles)
from Prometheus. The image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel on
Pandora and 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel on Prometheus. The view was
acquired from about a third of a degree below the ringplane.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
