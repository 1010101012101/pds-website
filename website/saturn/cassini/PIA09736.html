**Caption:**

Saturn's rings divide this scene, casting graceful shadows onto the planet. Below,
bright clouds hint at the turbulent world beneath the haze.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 13,
2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 750
nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 4.1 million
kilometers (2.5 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 24 kilometers (15 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
