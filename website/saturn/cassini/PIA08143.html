**Caption:**

Shadows drape Saturn's northern hemisphere, providing a different kind of
look at prominent features in the rings. From the lower left corner
upward, the visible features are: the shadow of the outer B ring, followed
by the wide, bright Cassini Division, then the A ring with the embedded
thin, bright Encke Gap and finally the dark, narrow F ring.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Feb. 18, 2006, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 750 nanometers, and at a distance of approximately 2.8 million
kilometers (1.7 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 16
kilometers (10 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
