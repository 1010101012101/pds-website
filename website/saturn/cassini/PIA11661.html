As the moon Enceladus eclipses its neighbor Mimas, Cassini records a scene
possible only around the time of Saturn's approaching equinox.

Seven images, each taken about 30 seconds apart, were combined to create this
movie which shows the shadow of Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles,
across) darkening Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles, across). Although
Saturn has eclipsed moons in previous images (see
[PIA11143](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11143) and
[PIA11508](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11508)), this is the
first time Cassini has imaged one of Saturn's moons being eclipsed by another
moon rather than the planet. The novel illumination geometry created as the
Saturnian system approaches equinox means that during this time moons orbiting
in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial rings can cast shadows onto the
rings and onto each other.

To learn more about this special time and to see a movie of a moon's shadow
moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

The images were taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on May 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-
Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 43 degrees. Image scale is 8 kilometers
(5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
