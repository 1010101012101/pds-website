**Caption:**

As the moon Enceladus eclipses its neighbor Mimas, Cassini records a scene 
possible only around the time of Saturn's approaching equinox.

Seven images, each taken about 30 seconds apart, were combined to create 
this movie which shows the shadow of Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 
miles, across) darkening Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles, across). 
Although Saturn has eclipsed moons in previous images (see [PIA11143](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11143) and 
[PIA11508](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11508)), this is the first time Cassini has imaged one of Saturn's moons 
being eclipsed by another moon rather than the planet. The novel 
illumination geometry created as the Saturnian system approaches equinox 
means that during this time moons orbiting in or near the plane of 
Saturn's equatorial rings can cast shadows onto the rings and onto each 
other.

To learn more about this special time and to see a movie of a moon's 
shadow moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html). 

The images were taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on May 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Mimas and at 
a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 43 degrees. Image scale is 8 
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
