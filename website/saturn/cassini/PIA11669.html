The outer edge of Saturn's B ring exhibits an unexpected feature in this movie
made from images captured by NASA's Cassini spacecraft. The images were
obtained early in the planet's equinox "season" -- the period leading up to
and away from August 11, 2009 when the sun was over the planet's equator and
lit the rings exactly edge on.

The B ring is shown at the top of the frame. The Cassini Division, a low-
density region that separates the A and B rings, dominates the middle of the
frame. The inner A ring is at the bottom.

It is apparent in the movie that the outer B ring edge location varies with
time. For a more detailed view and explanation for this behavior, see
[PIA12794](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12794).

But, about halfway through, an unusual, 20,000-kilometer-long (12,000-mile-
long), chevron-shaped structure can be seen moving along the B ring edge.
Higher resolution images, taken during equinox, have shown that this region is
the site of vertical structures, as tall as 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles), whose
existence was betrayed by long shadows (see
[PIA11668](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11668)).

Cassini imaging scientists found that this chevron feature is one of two sites
at the B ring's outer edge that does not follow any of the three newly
discovered rotating patterns distorting the ring's edge or another pattern
previously known to be caused by the moon Mimas. They have found instead that
it orbits Saturn as would an independently orbiting body. As a result,
scientists conclude that these are likely sites of massive bodies, or
moonlets, embedded near the ring's edge but independently orbiting Saturn. In
the particular region shown in this movie, the moonlets are likely big enough
to cause ring material streaming past them to be excessively compressed and
thrown vertically as a result. The moonlets themselves can't be seen.

This interpretation is supported by Cassini's previous discovery of a moonlet
embedded in this region of the B ring (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)). The imaged
moonlet, whose size is estimated at 300 meters (1,000 feet) across, was found
only because it was betrayed by the shadow it cast during Saturn's August 2009
equinox period.

This view looks toward the southern, sunlit side of the rings from about 4
degrees below the ring plane.

The movie is a concatenation of 39 images taken about 2 minutes, 40 seconds
apart, over the span of 1 hour, 40 minutes. The images, taken on Feb. 25,
2009, were re-projected into the same viewing geometry.

A full-size still image of one of the frames and a cropped version of the
still image are included here. The cropped version has been magnified by a
factor of three to increase visibility.

The images were taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 822,000
kilometers (511,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 154 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
