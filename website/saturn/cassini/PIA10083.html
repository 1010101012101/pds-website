**Caption:**

This is a computer simulation of the final stage of the growth of a
"clump" in Saturn's rings. The gravity from a hypothesized moonlet (solid
gray sphere in frame center) has collected smaller ring particles (black)
to form a temporary aggregation. The particles shown in the simulation are
from centimeters to meters (inches to yards) across. The gray moonlet is
61 meters (200 feet) across.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The
ultraviolet imaging spectrograph was designed and built at, and the team
is based at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
