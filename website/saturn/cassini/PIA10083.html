This is a computer simulation of the final stage of the growth of a "clump" in
Saturn's rings. The gravity from a hypothesized moonlet (solid gray sphere in
frame center) has collected smaller ring particles (black) to form a temporary
aggregation. The particles shown in the simulation are from centimeters to
meters (inches to yards) across. The gray moonlet is 61 meters (200 feet)
across.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph was designed and built at, and the team is based at the
University of Colorado, Boulder.
