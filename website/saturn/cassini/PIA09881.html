**Caption:**

This Cassini view features several interesting attributes that show how 
moons help shape the rings of Saturn.

The embedded moon Daphnis (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across) is seen in 
its narrow gap at lower right. The tiny moon is accompanied by its 
entourage of edge waves, visible as ripples in the gap's edges.

Right of center, the much broader Encke Gap displays its own edge waves, 
caused by Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across at its widest point). 
Also seen are several faint ringlets that inhabit the gap along with Pan.

Just outside, or leftward, of the Encke Gap is a dark, rippling moire 
pattern, which occurs when two separate patterns in the rings are 
superposed on each other but are oriented at different angles to each 
other. In this case, the moire pattern is created by interference between 
wakes caused by a recent passage of Pan and a spiral density wave created 
by the moon Prometheus. (See [PIA08824](PIA08824.html) for a 
closer view of a spiral density wave.)

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 4 
degrees above the ringplane. The narrow F ring arcs through the scene from 
lower right toward left. 

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on March 4, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel in the radial, or outward from 
Saturn, direction.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
