Although it may look to our eyes like other images of the rings, this infrared
image of Saturn's rings was taken with a special filter that will only admit
light polarized in one direction. Scientists can use these images to learn
more about the nature of the particles that make up Saturn's rings.

The bright spot in the rings is the "opposition surge" where the Sun-Ring-
Spacecraft angle passes through zero degrees. Ring scientists can also use the
size and magnitude of this bright spot to learn more about the surface
properties of the ring particles. To learn more about the surge, see
[PIA08247](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08247).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 19 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Aug. 18, 2013 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths
of near-infrared light centered at 705 nanometers.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 712,000 miles (1.1
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-rings-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 7 degrees. Image scale is 43 miles (68 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
