**Caption:**

The range of features to be found in Saturn's C ring is seen in this 
Cassini image.

Near the bottom of the frame is a narrow eccentric ringlet lying in a gap 
that researchers suspect may contain one or more very small moons. Farther 
up, the bright feature is one of the C ring's "plateaus." These bright 
features in the C ring are much denser than the surrounding material, and 
their origin is also being studied.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 9, 2008 at a distance of approximately 339,000 
kilometers (211,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 101 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
