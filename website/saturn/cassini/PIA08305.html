**Caption:**

The bright ringlets seen here are populated with microscopic icy particles
and are among the brightest features in the rings at high phase angles.

The twisted core of the F ring, at left, is flanked by three fainter
ringlets which are, in fact, part of a separate continuous structure that
spirals around the planet. Right of center, in the Encke Gap, are three
tortured-looking ringlets.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 12 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 7, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.9
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 163 degrees. Image scale is
about 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
