The bright ringlets seen here are populated with microscopic icy particles and
are among the brightest features in the rings at high phase angles.

The twisted core of the F ring, at left, is flanked by three fainter ringlets
which are, in fact, part of a separate continuous structure that spirals
around the planet. Right of center, in the Encke Gap, are three tortured-
looking ringlets.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 12 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 7, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers
(1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 163 degrees. Image scale is about 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
