**Caption:**

Two of Saturn's icy attendants race past on their circuit of the ringed 
beauty.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across), with its prominent crater 
Herschel, is seen at right. The shepherd moon Pandora (84 kilometers, or 
52 miles across) cruises along at center, just beyond Saturn's F ring. 
Orbiting nearly 44,000 kilometers (27,500 miles) closer to Saturn than its 
more distant neighbor, the swifter Pandora is about to overtake Mimas.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees 
below the ringplane. Shadows cast by the rings adorn the northern 
hemisphere.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 8, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance 
of approximately 3.1 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) from the two 
moons. Image scale is about 18 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel on both 
bodies.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
