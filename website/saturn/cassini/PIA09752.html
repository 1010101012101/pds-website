Two of Saturn's icy attendants race past on their circuit of the ringed
beauty.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across), with its prominent crater
Herschel, is seen at right. The shepherd moon Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52
miles across) cruises along at center, just beyond Saturn's F ring. Orbiting
nearly 44,000 kilometers (27,500 miles) closer to Saturn than its more distant
neighbor, the swifter Pandora is about to overtake Mimas.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees below
the ringplane. Shadows cast by the rings adorn the northern hemisphere.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 8, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
3.1 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) from the two moons. Image scale is
about 18 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel on both bodies.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
