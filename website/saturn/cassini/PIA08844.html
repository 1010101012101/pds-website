**Caption:**

Storms whip up the cloud bands of Saturn's southern hemisphere in this 
infrared view. Small fractions of the A and F rings are visible at right.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a 
spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of light centered at 890 
nanometers. The view was acquired on Dec. 1, 2006 at a distance of 
approximately 910,000 kilometers (566,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 130 degrees. Image scale is 51 
kilometers (32 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
