The propeller-shaped white dashes near the bottom of this Cassini spacecraft
image reveal the location of a small moonlet embedded in Saturn's A ring. The
gravity of this tiny moonlet affects the orbits of nearby ring particles and
creates the propeller feature, nicknamed Bleriot by imaging scientists, that
Cassini sees.

Researchers hope to understand more about the migration of planets during
their formation by studying how the orbits of Bleriot and other propeller
features observed by Cassini change over time. For more views of Bleriot, see
[PIA12789](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12789) and
[PIA12792](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12792).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 38 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Nov. 11, 2012.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 349,000 miles (561,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 41
degrees. Image scale is 2 miles (3 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
