**Caption:**

This close-up view of the core of Saturn's narrow outlying F ring provides
an unprecedented look at the fine scale structure of this highly perturbed
ring.

Like [PIA08290](PIA08290.html), the structure seen here could be further evidence
of the gravitational effects of small moons orbiting in the F ring region.
The moons could produce the basic structure which then starts to shear --
the inner/lower part of the F ring core orbits Saturn faster than the
outer/upper part -- giving rise to the slanted features.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 25, 2006 at a distance of approximately
254,000 kilometers (158,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 28 degrees. Scale in the
original image was 1 kilometer (3,845 feet) per pixel. The image has been
magnified by a factor of two and contrast enhanced.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
