Saturn's surface is painted with swirls and shadows. Each swirl here is a
weather system, reminding us of how dynamic Saturn's atmosphere is.

Images taken in the near-infrared (like this one) permit us to peer through
Saturn's methane haze layer to the clouds below. Scientists track the clouds
and weather systems in the hopes of better understanding Saturn's complex
atmosphere - and thus Earth's as well.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 17 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Feb. 8, 2015 using a spectral filter which preferentially
admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 794,000 miles (1.3
million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 47 miles (76 kilometers) per
pixel.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
