Swirling cloud bands, delicate ring shadows and icy moons make the Saturn
system a place of supreme natural beauty. Even Cassini's remarkable images can
only provide the slightest sense of the experience of actually being there.

Tethys (at the right, 1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) and Mimas (near
the center, 397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) are captured here against the
planet's turbulent atmosphere.

Although the rings are only a thin strip from this angle, one can see the
structure of the entire main ring system in its shadow on the planet -- from
the C ring at the bottom to the faint specter of the F ring at the top.

The image was taken in visible violet light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on July 16, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.2 million
kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 66 kilometers (41
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
