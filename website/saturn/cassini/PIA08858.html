**Caption:**

This psychedelic view of Saturn and its rings is a composite made from
images taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using spectral
filters sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 728, 752
and 890 nanometers.

Cassini acquired the view on Dec. 13, 2006 at a distance of approximately
822,000 kilometers (511,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 46
kilometers (28 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
