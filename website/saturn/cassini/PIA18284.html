Like a drop of dew hanging on a leaf, Tethys appears to be stuck to the A and
F rings from this perspective.

Tethys (660 miles, or 1,062 kilometers across), like the ring particles, is
composed primarily of ice. The gap in the A ring through which Tethys is
visible is the Keeler gap, which is kept clear by the small moon Daphnis (not
visible here).

This view looks toward the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Tethys. North on Tethys
is up and rotated 43 degrees to the right. The image was taken in visible
light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 14, 2014.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8
million kilometers) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 22 degrees. Image scale is 7 miles (11 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
