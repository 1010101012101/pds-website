**Caption:**

Saturn's shadow cuts across the rings in this view from high above the
ringplane. While in the shadow the ring particles cool off and then heat
up again when they enter the sunlight.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Oct. 18, 2008 at a distance of approximately 749,000
kilometers (465,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 44 degrees. Image scale is 41 kilometers (26 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
