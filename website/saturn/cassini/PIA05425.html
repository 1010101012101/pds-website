Two weeks after orbit insertion, Cassini glanced back at Saturn, taking in the
entire planet and its expansive rings. Currently it is summer in Saturn's
southern hemisphere. Notable here is the bright spot located near the planet's
southern hemisphere, where the line from the day and night side of the planet
meets. The angle of illumination hints at Saturn's tilt relative to the Sun.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide
angle camera on July 13, 2004, from a distance of about 5 million kilometers
(3.1 million miles) from Saturn. The Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase angle of
this image is 95 degrees. The image scale is 299 kilometers (186 miles) per
pixel. Contrast has been enhanced slightly to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
