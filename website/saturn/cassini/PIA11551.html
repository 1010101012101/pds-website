Atlas joins other moons casting shadows on Saturn's rings as the planet
approaches its August 2009 equinox.

Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across) orbits in the Roche Division between
the A ring and the thin F ring, and the moon can be see here casting its
shadow on the A ring and across the narrow Keeler Gap. The novel illumination
geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox allows moons
orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows
onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before
and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To
learn more about this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving
across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

Stars can be seen through the rings and in the background. They appear
elongated because of the camera's long exposure time.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 28, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (932,000 miles) from
Atlas and at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 82 degrees. Image
scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
