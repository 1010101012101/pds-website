**Caption:**

Cassini continues its vigil as Saturn's atmosphere churns and morphs 
through time. Four large, dark spots, or storms, form a symmetrical 
pattern in the mid-southern latitudes as these features squeeze past 
each other. Further observations will show whether these storms merge 
or spawn new spots of their own. North of the features, some latitudinal 
bands exhibit a bumpy or scalloped pattern, probably indicative of 
planet-scale wave motions in the atmosphere.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft's narrow angle camera on 
May 15, 2004, from a distance of 24.7 million kilometers (15.3 million 
miles) from Saturn through a filter centered at 750 nanometers. The image 
scale is 147 kilometers (91 miles) per pixel. Contrast in the image 
enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
