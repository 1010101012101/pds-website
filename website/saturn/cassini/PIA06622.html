This Cassini image shows Saturn's crater-covered moon Tethys as it slid
silently along in its orbit while Saturn's delicate rings sliced the view in
two. Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 23, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers
(1.3 million miles) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 78 degrees. The image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
