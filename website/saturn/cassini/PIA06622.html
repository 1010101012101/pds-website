**Caption:**

This Cassini image shows Saturn's crater-covered moon Tethys as it slid
silently along in its orbit while Saturn's delicate rings sliced the view
in two. Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 23, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1
million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Tethys and at a
Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 78 degrees. The image scale is
13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
