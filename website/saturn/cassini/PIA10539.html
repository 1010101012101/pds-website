**Caption:**

A large group of spokes emerges from Saturn's shadow in this image taken 
of the morning side of the rings. Such groupings may hold clues to the 
manner in which these features are formed.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Nov. 2, 2008 at a distance of approximately 869,000 
kilometers (540,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 37 degrees. Image scale is 48 kilometers (30 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
