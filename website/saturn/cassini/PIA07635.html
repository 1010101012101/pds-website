**Caption:**

Rhea floats below the innermost regions of Saturn's amazing rings. This
view of the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949
miles across) allows a glimpse of the wispy terrain that covers the
trailing hemisphere of Rhea.

(See [PIA06575](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06575)) & [PIA06578](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06578)) for similar views of the wispy terrain.)

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini narrow-angle camera
on Oct. 9, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers
(1.2 million miles) from Rhea and at a Sun-Rhea-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 51 degrees. The image scale is 12 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
