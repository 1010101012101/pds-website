This dramatic view of Saturn's rings draped by the shadow of Saturn, shows
brightness variations that correspond to differences in the concentration of
the ring particles as they orbit the planet.

The planet's western limb is visible in the upper right corner. Three of
Saturn's moons can be seen here: Bright Enceladus (499 kilometers, or 310
miles across) is visible near lower right; Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72
miles across) appears at center left; and interior to the F ring, near the top
of the image, is Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across). The F ring,
the outermost ring shown here, displays several knot-like features near the
left side of the image.

The image was taken in visible light by the Cassini spacecraft wide angle
camera on July 3, 2004, from a distance of 1.5 million kilometers (930,000
miles) from Saturn, at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of about 108
degrees. This is the first processed wide angle camera image to be released
since Cassini's encounter with Jupiter in 2000. The image scale is 87
kilometers (54 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
