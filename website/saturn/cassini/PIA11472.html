The fragile F ring bears the signs of a moon's bruising passage.

The A ring and its Keeler Gap sit idly by on the right of this image, but on
the left dark lines cut across the F ring and mark where the moon Prometheus
has gored the ring and gravitationally drawn streamer-channels of material
from the ring (see
[PIA10509](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10509)). To the left
and right of the bright core, the F ring also displays the ghostly stands of
its spiral arm (see
[PIAPIA07717](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIAPIA07717)) which
winds around the planet like a compressed spring.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 11 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in green light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 2, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 33 degrees. Image scale is
7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
