**Caption:**

The shepherding moon Pandora, near the bottom of the image, casts a shadow
on Saturn's thin F ring as the planet nears its August 2009 equinox.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) orbits outside the F ring and,
with the inner shepherd moon Prometheus (not seen in this image), helps to
keep the narrow lanes of the F ring in check.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane and causes out-of-plane structures to cast long
shadows across the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few
months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about
15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies of
moons' shadows moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html) and [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 15
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in green light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 25, 2009. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 575,000 kilometers (357,000 miles)
from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 25 degrees.
Image scale is 31 kilometers (19 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
