**Caption:**

Cassini looks down toward Janus, which hugs the outer edges of Saturn's
rings. Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) orbits Saturn about
11,250 kilometers (6,990 miles) beyond the narrow core of the F ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 6
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 26, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Janus and
at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 31 degrees. Image scale is
13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
