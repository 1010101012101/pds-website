Saturn's rings cut across this view of the planet's largest moon, Titan.

Dark albedo features on Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across) and
the moon's north polar hood are visible here. See
[PIA08137](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08137) and
[PIA09739](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09739) to learn more.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from just
below the ringplane and toward the Saturn-facing side of Titan. North on Titan
is up.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 12,
2011 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 938 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Titan and at a
Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 11 degrees. Image scale is 14
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
