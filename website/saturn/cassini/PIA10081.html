This is an artist concept of a close-up view of Saturn's ring particles. The
planet Saturn is seen in the background (yellow and brown). The particles
(blue) are composed mostly of ice, but are not uniform. They clump together to
form elongated, curved aggregates, continually forming and dispersing. The
space between the clumps is mostly empty. The largest individual particles
shown are a few meters (yards) across. Image by Marty Peterson, based on a
1984 image by William K. Hartmann. Hartmann's image illustrated early research
by Stuart Weidenschilling and co-workers at the Planetary Science Insitute, on
dynamical ephemeral bodies in Saturn's rings.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph was designed and built at, and the team is based at the
University of Colorado, Boulder.
