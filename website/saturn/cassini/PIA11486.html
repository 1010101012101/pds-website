Saturn's moon Tethys casts a wide shadow over the planet's F and A rings.

Tethys itself is not visible in this image. As Saturn approaches its August
2009 equinox, the planet's moons cast shadows onto the rings. To learn more
about this special time and to see a movie of a moon's shadow moving across
the rings, see [PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 36 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 21, 2009. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 142 degrees. Image scale is
63 kilometers (39 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
