**Caption:**

The F ring and outer edge of the A ring can be seen in this image. A kink
feature is visible in the F ring, probably caused by Prometheus or
Pandora, the F ring's shepherd moons.

Another moon, Daphnis, can be seen in the Keeler gap near the outer edge
of the A ring, along with the waves Daphnis raises on that gap's edges.
Waves like these allow researchers to locate new moons in gaps and also
estimate their masses.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 7, 2008 at a distance of approximately 992,000
kilometers (616,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 48 degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (3 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
