Saturn's small, potato-shaped moon Prometheus orbits between the main rings
and the thin F ring in this Cassini spacecraft view.

Prometheus can be seen just above the center of the image as it orbits in the
Roche Division. The gravitational influence of Prometheus (86 kilometers, or
53 miles across) periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. To
learn more and to watch a movie of this process, see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 15, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 15
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
