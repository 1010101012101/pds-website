A propeller-shaped structure, created by an unseen moon, can be seen in
Saturn's A ring.

The propeller, which looks like a small, dark line interrupting the bright
surrounding ring material, is in the upper left of this image near the edge of
the Keeler Gap. See
[PIA12790](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12790) to learn more
about propellers.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 16 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 3, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
279,000 kilometers (173,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 16 degrees. Image scale is 1 kilometer (3,300 feet) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
