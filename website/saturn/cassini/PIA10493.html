The Cassini spacecraft looks toward the sunlit face of Saturn's rings, whose
shadows continue to slide southward on the planet toward their temporary
disappearance during equinox in August 2009.

This two-frame color mosaic was created from images taken as part of a
photometry observation of the rings. Photometry observations are useful for
determining a host of ring particle properties.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 3 degrees below
the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were
combined to create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug. 22, 2008 at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (728,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 66 kilometers (41 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
