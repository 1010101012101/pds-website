**Caption:**

This colorful view, taken from edge-on with the ringplane, contains four
of Saturn's attendant moons. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, 665 miles across)
is seen against the black sky to the left of the gas giant's limb.
Brilliant Enceladus (505 kilometers, 314 miles across) sits against the
planet near right. Irregular Hyperion (280 kilometers, 174 miles across)
is at the bottom of the image, near left. Much smaller Epimetheus (116
kilometers, 72 miles across) is a speck below the rings directly between
Tethys and Enceladus. Epimetheus casts an equally tiny shadow onto the
blue northern hemisphere, just above the thin shadow of the F ring.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 24, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 116 kilometers (72 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
