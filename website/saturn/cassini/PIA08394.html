This colorful view, taken from edge-on with the ringplane, contains four of
Saturn's attendant moons. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, 665 miles across) is seen
against the black sky to the left of the gas giant's limb. Brilliant Enceladus
(505 kilometers, 314 miles across) sits against the planet near right.
Irregular Hyperion (280 kilometers, 174 miles across) is at the bottom of the
image, near left. Much smaller Epimetheus (116 kilometers, 72 miles across) is
a speck below the rings directly between Tethys and Enceladus. Epimetheus
casts an equally tiny shadow onto the blue northern hemisphere, just above the
thin shadow of the F ring.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 24, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 116
kilometers (72 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
