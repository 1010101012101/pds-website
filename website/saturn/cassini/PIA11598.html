The moon Prometheus creates an intricate pattern of perturbation in Saturn's F
ring while the moon Daphnis disturbs the A ring in this image taken after the
planet's August 2009 equinox.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) can be seen between the thin F
ring and the A ring in the middle left of the image. The gravity of potato-
shaped Prometheus periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. To
learn more and to watch a movie of this process, see
[PIA08397](/catalog/PIA08397).

Near the bottom of the image, Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) can be
seen creating edge waves in the Keeler Gap of the A ring. The moon has an
inclined orbit and its gravitational pull perturbs the orbits of the particles
of the A ring, forming the Keeler Gap's edge, and sculpts the edge into waves
having both horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components. Material on the
inner edge of the gap orbits faster than the moon so that the waves there lead
the moon in its orbit. Material on the outer edge moves slower than the moon,
so waves there trail the moon. These edge waves can be seen casting shadows in
this image. See [PIA11656](/catalog/PIA11656) to learn more about this
process.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog

/PIA11657)), but also the shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the
rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 6
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug.
22, 2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 862 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 129 degrees. Image scale is 12
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
