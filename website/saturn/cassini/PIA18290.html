Nature is an artist, and this time she seems to have let her paints swirl
together a bit.

What the viewer might perceive to be Saturn's surface is really just the tops
of its uppermost cloud layers. Everything we see is the result of fluid
dynamics. Astronomers study Saturn's cloud dynamics in part to test and
improve our understanding of fluid flows. Hopefully, what we learn will be
useful for understanding our own atmosphere and that of other planetary
bodies.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 25 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in red light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 23, 2014.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.7
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 23 degrees. Image scale is 63 miles (102 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
