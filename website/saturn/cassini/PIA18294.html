Saturn's main rings, seen here on their "lit" face, appear much darker than
normal. That's because they tend to scatter light back toward its source -- in
this case, the Sun.

Usually, when taking images of the rings in geometries like this, exposures
times are increased to make the rings more visible. Here, the requirement to
not over-expose Saturn's lit crescent reveals just how dark the rings actually
become. Scientists are interested in images in this sunward-facing ("high
phase") geometry because the way that the rings scatter sunlight can tell us
much about the ring particles' physical make-up.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 6 degrees above
the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 12, 2014.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles (2.3
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 152 degrees. Image scale is 86 miles (138 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
