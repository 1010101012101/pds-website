Befitting moons named for brothers, the moons Prometheus and Epimetheus share
a lot in common. Both are small, icy moons that orbit near the main rings of
Saturn. But, like most brothers, they also assert their differences: while
Epimetheus is relatively round for a small moon, Prometheus is elongated in
shape, similar to a lemon.

Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) orbits just outside the A ring
- seen here upper-middle of the image - while Epimetheus (70 miles, 113
kilometers across) orbits farther out - seen in the upper-left, doing an
orbital two-step with its partner, Janus.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 28 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 9, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 557,000 miles (897,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 11
degrees. Image scale is 33 miles (54 kilometers) per pixel. Prometheus and
Epimetheus have been brightened by a factor of 2 relative to the rest of the
image to enhance their visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
