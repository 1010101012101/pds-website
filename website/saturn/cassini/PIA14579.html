A quartet of Saturn's moons, from tiny to huge, surround and are embedded
within the planet's rings in this Cassini composition.

Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is in the background of the image, and the
moon's north polar hood is clearly visible. See
[PIA08137](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08137) to learn more
about that feature on Titan (3,200 miles, or 5,150 kilometers across). Next,
the wispy terrain on the trailing hemisphere of Dione (698 miles, or 1,123
kilometers across) can be seen on that moon which appears just above the rings
at the center of the image. See
[PIA10560](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10560) and
[PIA06163](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06163) to learn more
about Dione's wisps. Saturn's small moon Pandora (50 miles, or 81 kilometers
across) orbits beyond the rings on the right of the image. Finally, Pan (17
miles, or 28 kilometers across) can be seen in the Encke Gap of the A ring on
the left of the image.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible blue light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Sept. 17, 2011. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million miles (2.1 million kilometers) from Dione and at a
Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 8 miles
(13 kilometers) per pixel on Dione.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
