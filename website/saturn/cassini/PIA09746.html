**Caption:**

Saturn's narrow F ring displays a bright, double-stranded core, flanked by
fainter material. The continuing evolution of this quirky ring is an
ongoing subject of study for Cassini scientists.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 7, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 3.1 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 29 degrees. Image scale
is 18 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
