**Caption:**

This oblique view of Saturn shows what may be localized upwellings in the
clouds of Saturn's southern hemisphere. Although the contrast is low, a
vortex is visible near lower right.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 938 nanometers. The image was obtained using
the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 8, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 2.8 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 152 degrees. Image scale is
17 kilometers (10 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
