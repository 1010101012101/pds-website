**Caption:**

A pair of Saturn's moons accompany the planet and its rings in this image 
taken shortly after the planet's August 2009 equinox.

Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is in top left of the image. 
Tethys (1,062 kilometers, or 660 miles across) is on left, below Dione in 
the image. The vertically thin rings cast a narrow shadow on the planet 
around the time of equinox. This view looks toward the northern sunlit 
side of the rings from about 12 degrees above the ringplane. The rings 
have been brightened relative to the planet to increase visibility.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's 
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes 
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across 
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and 
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. 
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the 
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the 
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see 
[PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Aug. 18, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of 
approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn and 
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 114 degrees. Image scale is 
131 kilometers (81 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
