**Caption:**

The shadows of Saturn's rings appear as a narrow band on the planet in
this image taken as Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane and causes moons and out-of-plane structures to
cast long shadows across the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once
in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see
movies of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html) and [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

The rings have been brightened relative to the planet to enhance
visibility.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 21
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 25, 2009 using a spectral filter
sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 918
nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 620,000
kilometers (385,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 26 degrees. Image scale is 33 kilometers (21 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
