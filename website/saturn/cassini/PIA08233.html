**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft finds oddly-shaped Atlas gliding along the edge of
the A ring. The moon has a prominent equatorial bulge, which is
accentuated here by the grazing viewing angle of Cassini, making Atlas
appear pointy.

Cassini images revealed in 2004 that a faint ring of material coincides
with the orbit of Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across). See
[PIA06113](PIA06113.html) for more about "the Atlas ring."

This view looks upward, toward the lit side of Saturn's rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 30, 2006 at a distance of approximately
283,000 kilometers (176,000 miles) from Atlas. Image scale is 2 kilometers
(1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
