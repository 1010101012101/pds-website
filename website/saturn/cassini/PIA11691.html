**Caption:**

The moon Tethys is joined by two smaller moons in this movie from NASA's
Cassini spacecraft.

Observations of mutual moon-crossing events, in which one moon passes
close to or in front of another, help scientists refine their
understanding of the orbits of Saturn's moons. This movie is a
concatenation of 15 still images obtained over a span of about 33 minutes.
The images were re-projected to a uniform view, and computer interpolation
was used to smooth the moons' motions between the frames.

In the movie, Prometheus (86 kilometers, 53 miles across) enters the frame
from the right and passes behind Tethys (1,062 kilometers, 660 miles
across). Prometheus appears as a tiny bright dot beyond the main rings.
Pandora (81 kilometers, 50 miles across) can also be seen at the bottom of
the frame. The unlit side of the planet is on the left. Prometheus and
Pandora's average speeds are each about 16 kilometers per second (36,000
mph). Tethys travels at an average speed of about 11 kilometers per second
(25,000 mph).

(For other movies like this one, see [PIA11692](PIA11692.html) and [PIA11693](PIA11693.html).)

In this view, Tethys, at a distance of approximately 1.2 million
kilometers (746,000 miles), is closest to Cassini. Prometheus is farthest
from the spacecraft at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers
(994,000 miles). The part of the rings at the bottom of the image is
closer to Cassini than the rings at the top of the image. This view looks
toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 1 degree above
the ring plane.

The images were obtained in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 16, 2009. The view was acquired at a
Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 80 degrees. Scale on Tethys is 7
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
