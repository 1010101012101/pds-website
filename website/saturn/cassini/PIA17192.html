This graphic plots the source locations of the geysers scientists have located
on Enceladus' south polar terrain. The 36 most active geyser, or jet, sources
are marked by circles and color coded by the behavior of the grains erupting
from the geysers. Other, less active sources are marked by small black
squares.

Red sources produce structures that lead Enceladus in its orbit, blue sources
produce particles that trail the moon, and black sources produce both. Circle
size is proportional to the source activity level. Latitudes are plotted as
concentric circles centered on the south pole at 5-degree intervals.

Lines emanating from sources represent the projection of a source's central
emission vector onto Saturn's ringplane -- that is, the direction of a
source's emission projected onto a plane passing through Saturn's equator. In
this reference frame, Saturn is down and Enceladus' orbital motion to the
right.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
