Like a shepherd guarding his sheep, Prometheus keeps a lonely watch over the F
ring.

Gravitational interactions between the ring and its shepherd moons, Prometheus
(53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) and Pandora (not shown here), keep the F
ring narrowly confined. The five small, bright dots in this image (one of them
seen through the A ring, which is on the right) are stars.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 52
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 15, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 810,000 miles (1.3
million kilometers) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 110 degrees. Image scale is 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
