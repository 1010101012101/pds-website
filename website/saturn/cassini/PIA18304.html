In reality, Janus and the rings both orbit Saturn and are only weakly
connected to each other through their mutual gravitational tugs. At specific
locations in the rings, these gravitational tugs result in orbital resonances,
which lead to some beautiful waves being created in the rings. See
[PIA10452](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10452) for an example.
Janus is 111 miles, or 179 kilometers, across.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 19 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 5, 2014.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.2 million miles (2.0
million kilometers) from Janus and at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 35 degrees. Image scale is 7 miles (12 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
