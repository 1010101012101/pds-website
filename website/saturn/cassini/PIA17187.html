This plot shows the variation in brightness of the plume of material, composed
of all the geysers erupting from the south polar terrain of Saturn's moon
Enceladus, as a function of the moon's orbital position around Saturn. Two
observation sets are shown here: the blue dots (ISS) are data collected from
images taken in the visible portion of the spectrum with Cassini's imaging
cameras, and the red circles (VIMS) are data collected by Cassini's visual and
infra-red mapping spectrometer.

Both indicate a brightening of the plume at approximately the same orbital
position, which is delayed relative to predictions based on a simple tidal
stress model. However, the ISS data cover a complete orbit and allow the width
of the brightness signal to be measured.

The correlation of plume brightness with orbital position implies that tidal
stresses are important, but other effects are undoubtedly present. These range
from a delay in the eruption of materials to the surface, to a very viscous
ice shell that responds slowly to tidal forcing, to the presence of periodic
variations in the moon's spin.

Additional observations of the plume throughout the remainder of the Cassini
mission, as well as the development of more complete theoretical models, are
planned to address this issue.

A version of this plot was presented in a paper by Nimmo, Porco, and Mitchell,
and published in the online version of the _Astronomical Journal_ in July
2014: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45>.

A companion paper, by Nimmo _et al_. is available at:

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
