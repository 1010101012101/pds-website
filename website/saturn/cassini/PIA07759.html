**Caption:**

Recent Cassini images of Saturn's moon Enceladus backlit by the sun show
the fountain-like sources of the fine spray of material that towers over
the south polar region. The image was taken looking more or less broadside
at the "tiger stripe" fractures observed in earlier Enceladus images. It
shows discrete plumes of a variety of apparent sizes above the limb of the
moon.

The greatly enhanced and colorized image shows the enormous extent of the
fainter, larger-scale component of the plume.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
