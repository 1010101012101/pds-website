This image taken by the narrow angle camera on the Cassini spacecraft shows
Saturn's F ring. It was re-projected to appear as a straight line. The bright
object to the lower left is the moon Prometheus, which appears elongated due
to the re-projection. A faint stream of material, or streamer, appears to be
connecting the moon to the ring. This streamer probably formed when Prometheus
bobbed up and down in its orbit around Saturn and caused periodic
perturbations to the F ring.

The vertical scale is from 139, 000 kilometers to 141,000 kilometers (86,300
miles to 87,600 miles). The horizontal scale is 20 degrees, or one-eighteenth
of the entire F ring. This image was taken in mid-June, 2004\.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
