The F ring's shepherds, Prometheus and Pandora, join Epimetheus in this image
of three of Saturn's moons and the rings.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) can be seen orbiting inside the
thin F ring near the middle of the image. Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles
across) orbits outside the F ring to the left of Prometheus. Epimetheus (113
kilometers, or 70 miles across) orbits beyond the F ring near the bottom of
the image.

See [PIA07653](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07653) to learn
more about how Prometheus and Pandora "shepherd" the F ring.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 2 degrees below the ringplane. Several background stars are visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 2, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Prometheus and Pandora. The
view was acquired at a distance of approximately 2.6 million kilometers (1.6
million miles) from Epimetheus. Image scale is 15 kilometers (9 miles) per
pixel on Prometheus and Pandora. Image scale is 16 kilometers (10 miles) per
pixel on Epimetheus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
