**Caption:**

This moody true color portrait of Saturn shows a world that can, at times, 
seem as serene and peaceful as it is frigid and hostile. Saturn's 
unlit-side rings embrace the planet while their shadows caress the 
northern hemisphere.

Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) is a mere speck below the 
rings, just left of the terminator. The view was obtained from about 15 
degrees above the ringplane as Cassini continued its climb to higher 
orbital inclinations.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural color view. The image was acquired with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug. 18, 2006 at a distance of 
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 137 degrees. Image scale is 76 
kilometers (47 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
