**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Prometheus is seen orbiting inside the planet's F-ring, 
which exhibits some of the knotted structure for which it is renowned. 
Near the center, separating the A and B rings is the famous Cassini 
division. The image was taken with the Cassini narrow angle camera on 
May 10, 2004, at a distance of 27 million kilometers (16.8 million miles) 
from Saturn. Image scale is 161 kilometers (100 miles) per pixel. 
Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across. The image has been 
contrast-enhanced and magnified to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
