Although solid-looking in many images, Saturn's rings are actually
translucent. In this picture, we can glimpse the shadow of the rings on the
planet through (and below) the A and C rings themselves, towards the lower
right hand corner.

For centuries people have studied Saturn's rings, but questions about the
structure and composition of the rings lingered. It was only in 1857 when the
physicist James Clerk Maxwell demonstrated that the rings must be composed of
many small particles and not solid rings around the planet, and not until the
1970s that spectroscopic evidence definitively showed that the rings are
composed mostly of water ice.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 17 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Aug. 12, 2014 in near-infrared light centered at 752
nanometers.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles (2.3
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 24 degrees. Image scale is 85 miles (136 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
