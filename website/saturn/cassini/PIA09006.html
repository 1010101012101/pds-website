**Caption:**

Prometheus glides across the scene from left to right, sculpting and perturbing particles
in Saturn's F ring. The bright core of the F ring is visible near the ring's ansa, or outer
edge.

Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across.

This view looks toward the illuminated side of the rings from about 2 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera
on June 28, 2007 at a distance of approximately 279,000 kilometers (174,000 miles)
from Saturn. Image scale is 17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations
center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
