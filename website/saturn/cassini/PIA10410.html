Saturn's northern hemisphere is visible through its disc of icy particles.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the A ring from about 21 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 19, 2008. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 806,000 kilometers (501,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is about 4 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
