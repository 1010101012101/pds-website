Cassini caught this intriguing view of a dark storm near the limb of Saturn on
Sept. 9, 2004. The image shows a great deal of detail in the gas giant's
turbulent atmosphere.

The bright triangle at right is an overexposed part of Saturn's A ring, with
the F ring faintly visible beneath.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera at a
distance of 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million miles) from Saturn, through a
filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light. The image scale is 104
kilometers (65 miles) per pixel. The image was magnified by a factor of two
and slightly contrast-enhanced to improve visibility of features in the
atmosphere.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
