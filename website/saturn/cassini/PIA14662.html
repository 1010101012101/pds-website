Forever changing, the F ring takes on a ladder-like appearance in this recent
Cassini spacecraft image. Scientists believe that interactions between the F
ring and the moons Prometheus and Pandora cause the dynamic structure of the
ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 32
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 13, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 426,000 miles (686,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 162
degrees. Image scale is 2 miles (4 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
