Two images of Saturn's A and B ring showcase the opposition effect, a
brightness surge that is visible on Saturn's rings when the Sun is directly
behind the spacecraft.

This view is of the A ring. See
[PIA08248](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08248) for the view of
the B ring.

The opposition effect exists because of two contributing factors. One is due
to the fact that the shadows of ring particles directly opposite the Sun from
Cassini -- the region of opposition -- fall completely behind the particles as
seen from the spacecraft. These shadows are thus not visible to the
spacecraft: all ring particle surfaces visible to the spacecraft in these two
images are in sunlight and therefore bright. Much farther away from the region
of opposition, the ring particle shadows become more visible and the scene
becomes less bright. The brightness falls off in a circular fashion around the
opposition point. The main factor to the opposition surge in this image is an
optical phenomenon called "coherent backscatter." Here, the electromagnetic
signal from the rays of scattered sunlight making its way back to the
spacecraft is enhanced near the region of opposition because, instead of
canceling, the electric and magnetic fields comprising the scattered radiation
fluctuate in unison.

The images were taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on July 23, 2006 at a distance of approximately 262,000 kilometers
(163,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale in the radial, or outward from
Saturn, direction is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
