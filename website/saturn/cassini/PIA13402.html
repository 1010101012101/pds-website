This false-color composite image, constructed from data obtained by NASA's
Cassini spacecraft, shows the glow of auroras streaking out about 1,000
kilometers (600 miles) from the cloud tops of Saturn's south polar region. It
is among the first images released from a study that identifies images showing
auroral emissions out of the entire catalogue of images taken by Cassini's
visual and infrared mapping spectrometer.

In this image constructed from data collected in the near-infrared wavelengths
of light, the auroral emission is shown in green. Scientists designated blue
to indicate sunlight reflected at wavelengths from 2 to 3 microns, green to
indicate light from hydrogen ions at wavelengths between 3 and 4 microns and
red to indicate thermal emission at 5 microns. Saturn's rings and high
altitude haze only reflect sunlight at 3 microns or less, so they appear deep
blue. The glow from the aurora can only be seen at the wavelengths in the
green channel. The heat emission from the interior of Saturn is only seen at 5
microns wavelength in the spectrometer data, and thus appears red. The dark
spots and banded features in the image are clouds and small storms that
outline the deeper weather systems and circulation patterns of the planet.
They are illuminated from underneath by Saturn's thermal emission, and thus
appear in silhouette.

The composite image was made from 65 individual observations by Cassini's
visual and infrared mapping spectrometer on Nov. 1, 2008. The observations
were each six minutes long.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The visual and infrared
mapping spectrometer team is based at the University of Arizona, Tucson.
