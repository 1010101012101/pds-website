**Caption:**

In this image of a Saturnian Groundhog Day, the moon Epimetheus has seen
its shadow cast on the rings in a forecast of the future. Dramatic moon
shadows will dance across the brilliant platform of the rings as the
planet draws near its August 2009 equinox.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) was the first moon caught
by Cassini casting a shadow on the main rings in a series of observations
planned to document this unusual sight, both for its spectacle and for the
valuable clues the images might hold about vertical displacements in the
rings. In the coming weeks and months, other moons will join Epimetheus in
darkening the rings with their shadows.

In this image, Epimetheus is not visible, but it has begun to cast its
shadow onto the A ring. As the angle of the ringplane decreases until it
aligns with the rays of the sun at equinox, the shadows cast by the moons
will appear more frequently and will stretch farther across the rings.
Already spanning the Keeler Gap, Epimetheus' shadow reaches across about a
third of the distance to the larger Encke Gap. The faint F ring can be
seen on the right of the image.

The image was taken in visible light with NASA's Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 8, 2009. This view looks toward the sunlit
side of the rings from about 27 degrees below the ringplane. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000
miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 42
degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
