In this image of a Saturnian Groundhog Day, the moon Epimetheus has seen its
shadow cast on the rings in a forecast of the future. Dramatic moon shadows
will dance across the brilliant platform of the rings as the planet draws near
its August 2009 equinox.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) was the first moon caught by
Cassini casting a shadow on the main rings in a series of observations planned
to document this unusual sight, both for its spectacle and for the valuable
clues the images might hold about vertical displacements in the rings. In the
coming weeks and months, other moons will join Epimetheus in darkening the
rings with their shadows.

In this image, Epimetheus is not visible, but it has begun to cast its shadow
onto the A ring. As the angle of the ringplane decreases until it aligns with
the rays of the sun at equinox, the shadows cast by the moons will appear more
frequently and will stretch farther across the rings. Already spanning the
Keeler Gap, Epimetheus' shadow reaches across about a third of the distance to
the larger Encke Gap. The faint F ring can be seen on the right of the image.

The image was taken in visible light with NASA's Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Jan. 8, 2009. This view looks toward the sunlit side of the
rings from about 27 degrees below the ringplane. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 42 degrees. Image scale is
6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
