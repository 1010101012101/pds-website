Saturn's brilliant limb shines through the semi-transparent A ring, while the
outer F ring shepherd moon hangs against the black sky.

F-ring shepherding moon Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across), along
with the inner shepherd moon Prometheus (see
[PIA09887](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09887)), helps to keep
the narrow lanes of the F ring in check.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 15
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 5, 2008. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (814,000 miles) from
Pandora. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
