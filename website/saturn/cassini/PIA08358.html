Magnificent blue and gold Saturn floats obliquely as one of its gravity-bound
companions, Dione, hangs in the distance. The darkened rings seem to nearly
touch their shadowy reverse images on the planet below.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 9 degrees above
the ring plane. The rings glow feebly in the scattered light that filters
through them.

Dione is 1,126 kilometers (700 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Feb. 4, 2007, at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers
(800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 75 kilometers (47 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
