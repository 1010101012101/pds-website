**Caption:**

Prometheus tugs icy particles from the F ring into fanciful shapes like 
ropes of glowing neon.

Although Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) is overexposed 
here, the moon's irregular outline is quite easy to see.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 7 degrees 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 22, 2008. The view was obtained at 
a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (652,000 miles) from 
Saturn. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
