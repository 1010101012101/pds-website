**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Atlas, shown at the center of this image, orbits within the
Roche Division separating the A ring from the tenuous F ring.

To learn more about the small moon Atlas (30 kilometers, 19 miles across),
see [PIA08233](PIA08233.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 2, 2009. The view was
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000
miles) from Atlas and at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 105
degrees. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
