**Caption:**

Saturn's F ring displays magnificent structure following the passage of
Prometheus. Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) is seen between the
A and F rings, above center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 28
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 23, 2008. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1
million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 41 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
