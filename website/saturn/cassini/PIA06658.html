**Caption:**

This poetic wide-angle camera view of Saturn reveals several small, dark
storms in the southern latitudes, where storm activity has been prevalent
since before Cassini arrived in orbit.

Also notable here is the semi-transparent C ring, which is visible against
the backdrop of the planet.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on April 23, 2005, through a filter sensitive to
wavelengths of infrared light centered at 1028 nanometers and at a
distance of approximately 2.4 million kilometers (1.5 million miles)
from Saturn. The image scale is 142 kilometers (88 miles) per pixel.
