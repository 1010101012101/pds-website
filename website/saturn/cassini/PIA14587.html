A pair of Saturn's moons appear insignificant compared to the immensity of the
planet in this Cassini spacecraft view along the terminator where day
transitions to night.

The larger moon Enceladus (313 miles, or 504 kilometers across) is also on the
left, just a bit closer to the center of the image. Epimetheus (70 miles, or
113 kilometers across) appears as a tiny black speck on the far left of the
image, left of Enceladus, just below the thin line of the rings. The rings
cast wide shadows on the southern hemisphere of the planet.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 4,
2011 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 746,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Saturn and roughly
600,000 miles (1 million kilometers) from Enceladus and Epimetheus. Image
scale is about 47 miles (75 kilometers) per pixel on Saturn, 37 miles (60
kilometers) per pixel on Enceladus and 41 miles (66 kilometers) per pixel
Epimetheus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
