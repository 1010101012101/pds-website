**Caption:**

The shepherd moon Prometheus is lit partly by reflected light from Saturn
as it lurks near the heavily perturbed F ring.

The left side of Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is
overexposed by the blinding Sun, but hints of craters can be seen on the
Saturn-lit side.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 52 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on March 16, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.8
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 11
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
