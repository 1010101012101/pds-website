**Caption:**

This detailed view of Saturn's mid-B ring shows intriguing structure, the
cause of which has yet to be explained by ring scientists. The image shows
a radial location located between approximately 107,200 to 115,700
kilometers (66,600 to 71,900 miles) from Saturn.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Sept. 3, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers
(700,000 miles) from Saturn using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The image scale is 6 kilometers
(4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
