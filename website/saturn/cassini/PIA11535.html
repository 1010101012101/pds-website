**Caption:**

The effects of the moon Prometheus create intricate formations in Saturn's
thin F ring.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles
across) periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See [PIA10461](PIA10461.html) and
[PIA10593](PIA10593.html) to learn more. To watch a movie of this process, see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 9
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 26, 2009. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 922,000 kilometers (573,000 miles)
from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 27 degrees.
Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
