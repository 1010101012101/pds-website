Artist Concept of Particle Population in Saturn's Magnetosphere

This is an artist's concept of the Saturnian plasma sheet based on data from
Cassini magnetospheric imaging instrument. It shows Saturn's embedded "ring
current," an invisible ring of energetic ions trapped in the planet's magnetic
field.

Saturn is at the center, with the red "donut" representing the distribution of
dense neutral gas outside Saturn's icy rings. Beyond this region, energetic
ions populate the plasma sheet to the dayside magnetopause filling the faintly
sketched magnetic flux tubes to higher latitudes and contributing to the ring
current. The plasma sheet thins gradually toward the nightside. The view is
from above Saturn's equatorial plane, which is represented by grid lines. The
moon Titan's location is shown for scale. The location of the bow shock is
marked, as is the flow of the deflected solar wind in the magnetosheath.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The magnetospheric
imaging instrument was designed, built and is operated by an international
team lead by the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University,
Laurel, Md.
