It is no Great Red Spot, but these two side-by-side views show the longest-
lived electrical storm yet observed on Saturn by NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The views were acquired more than three months after the storm was first
detected from its lightning-produced radio discharges on Nov. 27, 2007. See
[PIA08410](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08410) for an earlier
color view of this storm. Cassini imaging scientists believe the storm to be a
vertically extended disturbance that penetrates from Saturn's lower to upper
troposphere.

The view at left was created by combining images taken using red, green and
blue spectral filters, and shows Saturn in colors that approximate what the
human eye would see. The storm stands out with greater clarity in the
sharpened, enhanced color view at right. This view combines images taken in
infrared, green and violet light at 939, 567 and 420 nanometers respectively
and represents an expansion of the wavelength region of the electromagnetic
spectrum visible to human eyes. This view looks toward the un-illuminated side
of the rings from about 3 degrees above the ringplane. Janus (181 kilometers,
or 113 miles across) appears as a dark speck just beneath the rings in both
images.

These images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on
March 4, 2008, at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 74 kilometers (46 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo. The radio and plasma wave science team is based at the
University of Iowa, Iowa City.
