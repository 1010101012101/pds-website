**Caption:**

It is no Great Red Spot, but these two side-by-side views show the 
longest-lived electrical storm yet observed on Saturn by NASA's Cassini 
spacecraft.

The views were acquired more than three months after the storm was first 
detected from its lightning-produced radio discharges on Nov. 27, 2007. 
See [PIA08410](PIA08410.html) for an earlier color view of this storm. Cassini imaging 
scientists believe the storm to be a vertically extended disturbance that 
penetrates from Saturn's lower to upper troposphere. 

The view at left was created by combining images taken using red, green 
and blue spectral filters, and shows Saturn in colors that approximate 
what the human eye would see. The storm stands out with greater clarity in 
the sharpened, enhanced color view at right. This view combines images 
taken in infrared, green and violet light at 939, 567 and 420 nanometers 
respectively and represents an expansion of the wavelength region of the 
electromagnetic spectrum visible to human eyes. This view looks toward the 
un-illuminated side of the rings from about 3 degrees above the ringplane. 
Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) appears as a dark speck just 
beneath the rings in both images.

These images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera 
on March 4, 2008, at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers 
(800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 74 kilometers (46 miles) per 
pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo. The radio and plasma wave science team 
is based at the University of Iowa, Iowa City.
