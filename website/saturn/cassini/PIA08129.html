**Caption:**

This contrast-enhanced view of Saturn's faint G ring shows its extremely 
sharp inner edge and more diffuse outer boundary. Using its large 
high-gain antenna as a shield, the Cassini spacecraft flew through the 
region interior to the G ring during insertion into Saturn orbit. The 
spacecraft was struck many times by the fine icy particles that populate 
the region between the F and G rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 19, 2006, at a distance of approximately 1.2 
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 7 
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
