**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks toward daybreak on Saturn through the
delicate strands of the C ring. Some structure and contrast is visible in
the clouds far below.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 18 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera using
a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
862 nanometers. The view was acquired on Nov. 4, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn and at
a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 162 degrees. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
