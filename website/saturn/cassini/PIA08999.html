**Caption:**

Saturn's enchanting rings display crisply defined edges and strong
contrast on their unilluminated side.

Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) sits on the far side of the
rings above center, between the A and F rings. This view was acquired
from about 1 degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 21, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.4
million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Atlas. Image scale is 14
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
