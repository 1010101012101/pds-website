**Caption:**

The sharp change in brightness that runs diagonally across the center of 
this image represents the boundary between Saturn's C and B rings.

This location sits at about 92,000 kilometers (57,200 miles) from Saturn.

The B ring (at lower left) appears darker than the C ring from this 
perspective, above the unilluminated side of the rings, because the more 
densely populated B ring strongly attenuates sunlight passing through it.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on April 7, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (888,000 miles) from Saturn, and 
from about 32 degrees above the ringplane. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
