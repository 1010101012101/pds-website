As if trying to get our attention, Mimas is positioned against the shadow of
Saturn's rings, bright on dark. As we near summer in Saturn's northern
hemisphere, the rings cast ever larger shadows on the planet.

With a reflectivity of about 96 percent, Mimas (246 miles, or 396 kilometers
across) appears bright against the less-reflective Saturn.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 10 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on July 13, 2014 using a spectral filter which preferentially
admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8
million kilometers) from Saturn and approximately 1 million miles (1.6 million
kilometers) from Mimas. Image scale is 67 miles (108 kilometers) per pixel at
Saturn and 60 miles (97 kilometers) per pixel at Mimas.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
