Saturn's F ring shows several "mini-jets" near the upper-right of this image
captured by the Cassini spacecraft. The A ring also appears in the lower-left
of the image.

The mini-jets are thought by scientists to be caused by low-speed collisions
in the core of the F ring ejecting dusty material from the core. For more on
the mini-jets, see
[PIA15504](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15504).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 10 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 14, 2012.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 538,000 miles (867,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 10
degrees. Image scale is 3 miles (5 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
