**Caption:**

Saturn looms large before the Cassini spacecraft, its blustery cloud bands
in restless motion.

This view looks toward Saturn's mid-northern latitudes from about 37
degrees above the ringplane. Ring-cast shadows create dark bands across
the planet.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb.
18, 2008 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared
light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (783,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
