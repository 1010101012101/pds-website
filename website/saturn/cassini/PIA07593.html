**Caption:**

Cassini's prying infrared vision allows details of Saturn's storm-ridden
hydrogen atmosphere to be revealed as never before.

North of the dark south polar region is what may be a "polygonal wave"
structure developing in the atmosphere. Such a wave was seen in the
northern polar region in images from NASA's Voyager spacecraft and had a
hexagon shape that surrounded the pole.

This view has been magnified and enhanced to improve contrast in the
visible features. The image was taken using a compression scheme that
decreases image file size for storage onboard the spacecraft, and thus
the image appears slightly blocky, or "pixelated" following enhancement.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July
31, 2005, through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers at a distance of approximately 1.4 million
kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 36 degrees. Resolution in the original image was 78
kilometers (48 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
