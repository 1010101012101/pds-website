Two pairs of moons make a rare joint appearance. The F ring's shepherd moons,
Prometheus and Pandora, appear just inside and outside of the F ring (the thin
faint ring furthest from Saturn). Meanwhile, farther from Saturn the co-
orbital moons Janus (near the bottom) and Epimetheus (about a third of the way
down from the top) also are captured.

Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) and Pandora (50 miles, or 81
kilometers across) sculpt the F ring through their gravitational influences.
Janus (111 miles, or 179 kilometers across) and Epimetheus (70 miles, or 113
kilometers across) are famous for their orbital dance, swapping places about
every four years. They are also responsible for gravitationally shaping the
outer edge of the A ring into seven scallops.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 47 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 11, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 810,000 miles (1.3
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 47 degrees. Image scale is 47 miles (76 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
