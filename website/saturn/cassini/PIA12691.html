Saturn's small, ring-embedded moon Pan, on the extreme right of this Cassini
spacecraft image, can be seen interacting with the ringlets that share the
Encke Gap of the A ring with this moon.

Pan is 28 kilometers, or 17 miles, across. This view looks toward the
northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 11 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 2, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
875,000 kilometers (544,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 130 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
