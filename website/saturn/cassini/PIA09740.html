**Caption:**

Rhea transits the banded clouds of the Ringed Planet. The edge-on rings
cast curved shadows onto Saturn's northern hemisphere. More subtle than
the ring shadows, the zonal jet streams of Saturn stripe its globe.

Rhea is 1,528 kilometers (949 miles) across. Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247
miles across) sits on the far side of the ringplane, near right.

The image was taken in visible blue light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Aug. 13, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 4.1 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 240 kilometers (149 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
