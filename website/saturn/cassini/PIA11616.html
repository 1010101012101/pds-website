**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks past the night side of Saturn, dimly lit on
the left of this image by ringshine, for a subtly distorted view of the
planet's rings.

Light passing through the upper reaches of the planet's atmosphere is
refracted, or bent, distorting the view of the rings beyond. See [PIA07521](PIA07521.html) to learn more.

Bright specks in the image are background stars. This view looks toward
the sunlit, northern side of the rings from about 9 degrees above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 7, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 3 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 102 degrees. Image scale is
17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
