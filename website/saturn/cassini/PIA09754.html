**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks upward from beneath the ringplane to spy the
moon Mimas floating above the shadowed cloudtops of the Saturnian north.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 5 degrees
below the ringplane. Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles) across. The rings
themselves produce the shadows which, from this perspective, appear to
overlay.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Sept. 18, 2007, using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 750 nanometers. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 3.4 million kilometers (2.1 million miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 20 kilometers (13 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
