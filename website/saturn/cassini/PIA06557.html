**Caption:**

Cassini pierced Saturn's ring plane on Dec. 14, 2004, and swiped this 
sidelong glance at the planet and its magnificent rings. Saturn's tilt 
relative to the Sun throws dramatic shadows of the rings onto the planet's 
northern hemisphere. Details in Saturn's swirling atmosphere are also 
visible here.

This view looks down onto the dark side of the rings. The rings are lit 
from below, and both dense and empty regions appear dark, while regions 
of intermediate particle density are bright.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera at a 
distance of approximately 654,000 kilometers (406,000 miles) from Saturn 
through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 
728 nanometers. The image scale is 35 kilometers (22 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard 
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team 
is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
