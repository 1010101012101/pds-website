Saturn's moon Prometheus casts a shadow near a streamer-channel created by the
moon in the thin F ring in this image taken about a month after the planet's
August 2009 equinox.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) can also be seen on the right of
the image. Pandora orbits outside the F ring and, with the inner shepherd moon
Prometheus, helps to keep the narrow lanes of the F ring in check. The gravity
of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) periodically
creates streamer-channels in the F ring, and the moon's handiwork can be seen
below the shadow in this image. To learn more and to watch a movie of this
process, see [PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

The shadow of the planet cuts across the bottom of the image.

Bright specks in the image are background stars.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the sunlit, northern side of the rings from about 6
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 117 degrees. Image scale is 15 kilometers (9
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
