**Caption:**

Enceladus continues to exhale water ice into Saturn orbit, keeping the E 
ring topped off with tiny particles. 

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is a source of much 
interest for planetary scientists, being nearly seven times smaller in diameter
 than Earth's own moon, yet having active geology that appears to involve 
near-surface liquid water.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 11, 2006 at a distance of approximately 2.2 
million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Enceladus and at a 
Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 164 degrees. Image scale is 
13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
