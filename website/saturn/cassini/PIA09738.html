**Caption:**

Cassini puts the enormous distances in the Saturn system in perspective with this
view of Rhea and Prometheus.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) sits in the foreground, while Prometheus
(102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) lingers barely visible near the rings about 400,000 kilometers (250,000 miles) beyond. Saturn's cloud tops are about 80,000 kilometers
(50,000 miles) farther still.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a degree
above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 13,
2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 750
nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 4.1 million
kilometers (2.5 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 24 kilometers (15 miles)
per pixel on Saturn and 21 kilometers (13 miles) per pixel on Rhea.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
