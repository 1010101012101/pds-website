**Caption:**

An intriguing knotted ringlet within the Encke Gap is the main attraction
in this Cassini image.  The Encke Gap is a small division near the outer
edge of Saturn's rings that is about 300 kilometers (190 miles) wide. The
tiny moon Pan (20 kilometers, or 12 miles across) orbits within the gap
and maintains it.  Many waves produced by orbiting moons are visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow
angle camera on Oct. 29, 2004, at a distance of about 807,000 kilometers
(501,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
