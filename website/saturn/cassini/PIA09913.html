A great, eye-like vortex stares out of Saturn's roiling atmosphere. The storm
is wide enough to span the distance from Washington, DC to London. Bright
Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) drifts past in the foreground.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 3
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 23,
2008 using a combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of
polarized infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at
a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (783,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
