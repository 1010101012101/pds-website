**Caption:**

Saturn's shadow spreads across the rings here, extending beyond the F
ring and its tenuous, flanking ringlets. This view catches Saturn's moon
Mimas on its day-long sojourn around the planet. Mimas is 397 kilometers
(247 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 24, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1
million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Mimas and at a
Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 84 degrees. The image scale is
13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
