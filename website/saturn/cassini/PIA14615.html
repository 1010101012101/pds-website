Saturn's rings cast wide shadows on the planet, and the shadow of a moon also
graces the gas giant in this scene from the Cassini spacecraft.

The moon Enceladus is not shown in this view, but it does cast a small,
elongated shadow on the planet near the bottom of this view. The moon Mimas
(246 miles, or 396 kilometers across) is visible as a bright dot on the far
right of the image in the ring plane.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 2 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 14,
2012 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.7 million miles (2.8 million kilometers) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 51 degrees. Image scale is 105 miles
(170 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
