**Caption:**

Myriad vortices churn through Saturn's high northern latitudes while
Dione's shadow drifts across the gas giant's face.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 43
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on May
7, 2008 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (760,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 69 kilometers (43 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
