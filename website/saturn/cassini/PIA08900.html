High above the streamers of cloud in Saturn's atmosphere, the planet's immense
ring system begins with faint, thin rings populated with dust-sized ice
particles. Here, features in the D ring are visible, beginning at about 67,000
kilometers (42,000 miles) from the planet's center.

Stars trail across the background during this exposure, timed to capture the
faint light from these D ring features.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 59 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 9, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
