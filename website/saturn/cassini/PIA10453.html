Two ring moons sweep through the scene as Cassini focuses on Saturn's
intriguing F ring.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is seen at right with its edge waves
in the Keeler Gap. Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) appears at
left.

This image is part of a movie sequence designed to observe the appearance of
the F ring and its faint flanking ringlets. As such, the exposure was not
optimized to image Pandora, therefore the moon is overexposed.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 22
degrees above the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 5, 2008. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (718,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
