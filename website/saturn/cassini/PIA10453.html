**Caption:**

Two ring moons sweep through the scene as Cassini focuses on Saturn's
intriguing F ring.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is seen at right with its edge
waves in the Keeler Gap. Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across)
appears at left.

This image is part of a movie sequence designed to observe the appearance
of the F ring and its faint flanking ringlets. As such, the exposure was
not optimized to image Pandora, therefore the moon is overexposed.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 22
degrees above the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 5, 2008. The view was
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (718,000
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
