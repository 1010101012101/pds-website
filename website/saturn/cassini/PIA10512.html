**Caption:**

The shadow of Tethys drifts across the face of Saturn. Nearby, shadows of
the planet's rings form a darkened band above the equator.

This view looks toward Saturn from a vantage point 63 degrees north of the
equator.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Oct. 1, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 615,000 kilometers (382,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 37 kilometers (23 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
