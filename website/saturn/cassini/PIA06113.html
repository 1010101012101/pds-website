**Caption:**

A new found ring of material, S/2004 1 R, in the orbit of Saturn's moon
Atlas has been seen in this view of the region between the edge of
Saturn's A ring and the F ring.

The image was taken by the Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera on July
1, 2004, just after the spacecraft had crossed the ring plane following
Saturn orbit insertion.

The maximum radial resolution is approximately 7 kilometers (4 miles) per
pixel. The region from the A ring to the F ring spans some 3,500
kilometers (2,200 miles). The image has been enhanced to show the
presence of faint ring material just beyond the edge of the A ring and
in the orbit of Atlas (indicated by the red line in the image on the
right). The moon Prometheus (102 kilometers or 63 miles across) can be
seen close to the F ring at the lower left of the image.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
