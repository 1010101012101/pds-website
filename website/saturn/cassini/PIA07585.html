This infrared view of Saturn's southern hemisphere shows the bright, high
altitude equatorial band at the top, and the now familiar dark bull's-eye that
marks the planet's south pole. At the mid-latitudes in between, several storms
swirl across the planet.

This image was taken using a compression scheme that allows more images to be
taken by Cassini. They are stored on its flight data recorder, which has
limited space - at the expense of some data quality. Due to the compression,
the image retains a blocky, or "pixilated," quality after enhancement. Despite
these artifacts, such compression can be useful for increasing the number of
images that can be taken and relayed back to Earth.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 31,
2005, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
728 nanometers at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 35
degrees. Resolution in the original image was 77 kilometers (48 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
