**Caption:**

Vertical ring structures created by the moon Daphnis cast dark shadows on 
Saturn's A ring in this image taken as the planet approached its August 
2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is a bright dot casting a thin 
shadow just in the middle right side of the image. The moon has an 
inclined orbit, and its gravitational pull perturbs the orbits of the 
particles of the A ring forming the Keeler Gap's edges and sculpts the 
edges into waves having both horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane 
components. See [PIA11655](PIA11655.html) to learn more and to see a movie of this process.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August 
2009 equinox allows out-of-plane structures and moons orbiting in or near 
the plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. 
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after 
Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn 
more about this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving 
across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html) and 
[PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 38 
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on July 15, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Daphnis 
and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 92 degrees. Image 
scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
