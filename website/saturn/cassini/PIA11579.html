Vertical ring structures created by the moon Daphnis cast dark shadows on
Saturn's A ring in this image taken as the planet approached its August 2009
equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is a bright dot casting a thin
shadow just in the middle right side of the image. The moon has an inclined
orbit, and its gravitational pull perturbs the orbits of the particles of the
A ring forming the Keeler Gap's edges and sculpts the edges into waves having
both horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components. See
[PIA11655](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) to learn more
and to see a movie of this process.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows out-of-plane structures and moons orbiting in or near the
plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These
scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about
this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving across the rings,
see [PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 38
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 15, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 92 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
