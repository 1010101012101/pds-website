**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft samples a bit of Saturn's southern hemisphere along 
with a spread of the planet's main rings.

Working outward from the planet, the C, B, and A rings are visible in this 
natural color image. The rings have been brightened relative to the planet 
to enhance their visibility.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 59 degrees 
below the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral 
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were 
acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 23, 2009 
at a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (621,000 miles) from 
Saturn. Image scale is 58 kilometers (36 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
