The Cassini spacecraft samples a bit of Saturn's southern hemisphere along
with a spread of the planet's main rings.

Working outward from the planet, the C, B, and A rings are visible in this
natural color image. The rings have been brightened relative to the planet to
enhance their visibility.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 59 degrees
below the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters
were combined to create this natural color view. The images were acquired with
the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 23, 2009 at a distance of
approximately 1 million kilometers (621,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is
58 kilometers (36 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
