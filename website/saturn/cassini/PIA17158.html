Saturn's moon Prometheus orbits near some of its handiwork in the F ring.

Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) and its partner Pandora
gravitationally sculpt and maintain the narrow F ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 53
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 24, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 104 degrees. Image scale is 7 miles (11 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
