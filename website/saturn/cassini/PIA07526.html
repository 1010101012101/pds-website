**Caption:**

The bright crescent of Saturn's moon Dione skims along just above Saturn's 
ringplane as storms churn in the planet's atmosphere below. Dione is 1,118 
kilometers (695 miles) across.

The spectral filter used to capture this observation is particularly 
sensitive to high altitude clouds above most of the methane gas in 
Saturn's atmosphere. Dark areas in this view are regions where light 
penetrates the atmosphere unimpeded by such thin, high clouds. 

Notable near the upper right is the turbulent southern boundary of 
Saturn's bright mid-equatorial zone. Cassini measured wind speeds at the 
altitude of the high, bright clouds north of this boundary to be 250 to 
300 meters per second (560 to 670 miles per hour).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on May 5, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.3 
million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn using a combination of 
filters sensitive to wavelengths of polarized and infrared light centered 
at 705 and 728 nanometers, respectively. The image scale is 74 kilometers 
(46 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
