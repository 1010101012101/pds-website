**Caption:**

The left image is a false-color view of Saturn's A ring from the
ultraviolet imaging spectrograph instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft.

The ring is the bluest in the center, where the gravitational clumps are
the largest. The thickest black band in the ring is the Enke Gap, and the
thin black band further to the right is the Keeler Gap.

The right image is a computer simulation about 150 meters (490 feet)
across illustrating a clumpy region of particles in the A ring. The
particles are moving counterclockwise, from bottom to top.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The
ultraviolet imaging spectrograph was built at, and the team is based at
the University of Colorado, Boulder.
