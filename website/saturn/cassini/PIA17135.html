While the moon Epimetheus passes by, beyond the edge of Saturn's main rings,
the tiny moon Daphnis carries on its orbit within the Keeler gap of the A
ring. Although quite different in size, both moons create waves in the rings
thanks to their gravitational influences.

Epimetheus (70 miles, or 113 kilometers across) is visible at the lower-right
of the image, and Daphnis (5 miles, or 8 kilometers across) is barely visible
at one pixel wide just below-right of the image center. A close inspection of
the image also reveals the waves Daphnis creates on the edges of the Keeler
gap.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 2.6
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 28, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 808,000 miles (1.3
million kilometers) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 28 degrees. Image scale is 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
