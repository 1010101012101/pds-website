**Caption:**

A pair of moons, Pandora and Prometheus, continue their shepherding duties 
near Saturn's thin F ring.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) orbits outside the F ring and, 
with the inner shepherd moon Prometheus, helps to keep the narrow lanes of 
the F ring in check. The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 
kilometers, or 53 miles across) periodically creates the streamer-channels 
seen here in the F ring. See [PIA08397](PIA08397.html) to learn more.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 
10 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 20, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. 
Image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
