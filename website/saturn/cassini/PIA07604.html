**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Pandora glides in front of the narrow F ring, making the
moon's oblong outline visible. The image also shows the A ring, Cassini
Division, B ring, and part of the C ring. This view is from beneath the
ring plane. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 23, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.6
million kilometers (1 million miles) from Pandora and at a
Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 97 degrees. Resolution in the
original image was 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
