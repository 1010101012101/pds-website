**Caption:**

The rings share this view with Mimas, a moon whose gravity influences the
rings.

To learn more about Mimas' gravitational influences, or resonances, see
[PIA10421](PIA10421.html) and [PIA07537](PIA07537.html). Mimas (396 kilometers, or
246 miles across) was overexposed in this image and has been dimmed by a
factor of four relative to the rest of the image.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 9
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 7, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
