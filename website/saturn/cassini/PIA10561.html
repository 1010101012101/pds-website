This November 2008 Cassini snapshot showcases a classic view of the triangular
shape typical of many of the spokes in Saturn's outer B ring.

Small particles in the ring compose the spokes and these wedge-shaped patterns
seem to be appearing more often as Saturn approaches equinox.

The moons Pan, Pandora and Janus are also visible. Janus (179 kilometers, or
111 miles across) is farthest outside the rings. Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50
miles across) orbits outside the faint F ring. Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles
across) is near the top right of the image and can be seen as a faint sphere
cutting a path in the thin black strip of the Encke Gap in the A ring.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 12 degrees
below the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 10, 2008 at a distance of approximately
1.029 million kilometers (639,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 29 degrees. Image scale is 58 kilometers (36
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
