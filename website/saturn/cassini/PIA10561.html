**Caption:**

This November 2008 Cassini snapshot showcases a classic view of the 
triangular shape typical of many of the spokes in Saturn's outer B ring.

Small particles in the ring compose the spokes and these wedge-shaped 
patterns seem to be appearing more often as Saturn approaches equinox.

The moons Pan, Pandora and Janus are also visible. Janus (179 kilometers, 
or 111 miles across) is farthest outside the rings. Pandora (81 
kilometers, or 50 miles across) orbits outside the faint F ring. Pan (28 
kilometers, or 17 miles across) is near the top right of the image and can 
be seen as a faint sphere cutting a path in the thin black strip of the 
Encke Gap in the A ring.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 12 degrees 
below the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 10, 2008 at a distance of 
approximately 1.029 million kilometers (639,000 miles) from Saturn and at 
a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 29 degrees. Image scale is 58 
kilometers (36 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
