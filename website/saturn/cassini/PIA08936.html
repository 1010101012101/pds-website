**Caption:**

Brooding Saturn seems to be missing its rings, but their shadows on the
planet betray their presence. The inner rings are in fact contained within
this scene, but they are so tenuous as to be nearly invisible.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 52
degrees above the ringplane. Some motion is apparent in Saturn's clouds
between the exposures used to create this color composite, as evidenced by
the 'rainbow' effect seen here and there across the face of the planet.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 5, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 1.5 million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 84 kilometers (52 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
