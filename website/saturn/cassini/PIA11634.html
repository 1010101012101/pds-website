**Caption:**

A moon's shadow strikes Saturn's rings near bright spokes on the B ring
near the center of this Cassini image taken about one month after the
planet's August 2009 equinox.

Mimas, the moon casting the shadow, is not shown. To learn more about the
ghostly radial markings called spokes, see [PIA11144](PIA11144.html) and [PIA08288](PIA08288.html).
Spokes appear bright when they are viewed at phase, or Sun-Saturn
spacecraft, angles higher than about 45 degrees. The phase angle in this
image is 106 degrees.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html) also the shadows of
newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 9, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 106 degrees. Image
scale is 17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
