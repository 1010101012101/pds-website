**Caption:**

Dark ring shadows adorn the northern hemisphere of Saturn. The shadows have loosened 
their grip on the north compared to when Cassini arrived in 2004 (see [PIA06177](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06177)), and 
presently continue to slide farther south.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 5 degrees above the 
ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to create this natural 
color view. The view was acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 22, 
2007, at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (839,000 miles) from Saturn. 
Image scale is 77 kilometers (48 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space 
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's 
Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard 
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations 
center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
