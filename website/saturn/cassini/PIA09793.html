Dark ring shadows adorn the northern hemisphere of Saturn. The shadows have
loosened their grip on the north compared to when Cassini arrived in 2004 (see
[PIA06177](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06177)), and presently
continue to slide farther south.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 5
degrees above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The view was acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 22, 2007, at a distance of approximately
1.3 million kilometers (839,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 77
kilometers (48 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
