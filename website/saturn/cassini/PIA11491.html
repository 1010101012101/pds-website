**Caption:**

The short and slender shadow of Pan is cast over Saturn's A ring as the 
moon orbits within the Encke Gap.

As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox, the planet's moons are 
casting shadows onto the rings. To learn more about this special time and 
to see a movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html). 

The shadow of the small moon Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) is 
much smaller than those cast by larger moons, such as Tethys (see [PIA11483](PIA11483.html)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 16 degrees 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 10, 2009. The view was acquired at 
a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (621,000 miles) from Pan 
and at a Sun-Pan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 44 degrees. Image scale is 
6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
