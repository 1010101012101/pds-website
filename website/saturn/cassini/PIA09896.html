Saturn's semitransparent rings arc smoothly around the gas giant, abruptly
disappearing where they pass through the planet's shadow.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on April 15, 2008 using a spectral filter sensitive to
wavelengths of infrared light centered at 728 nanometers. The view was
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (907,000 miles)
from Saturn. Image scale is 84 kilometers (52 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
