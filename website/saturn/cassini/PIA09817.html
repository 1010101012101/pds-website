Saturn's rings sweep around the planet, throwing their dark shadows onto the
northern hemisphere.

The equatorial region is generally brighter than the rest of the planet in
Cassini spacecraft views, but the contrast is often striking in monochrome
views like this, taken in the infrared part of the spectrum at wavelengths
sensitive to methane absorption in the planet's atmosphere. (Compare, for
example, [PIA08392](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08392) and
[PIA07669](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07669).)

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 24
degrees above the ringplane.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
