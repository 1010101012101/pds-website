Saturn's moon Tethys, with its stark white icy surface, peeps out from behind
the larger, hazy, colorful Titan in this view of the two moons obtained by
NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Saturn's rings lie between the two.

The north polar hood can be seen on Titan appearing as a detached layer at the
top of the moon here. See
[PIA08137](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08137) and
[PIA09739](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09739) to learn more
about Titan's atmosphere and the north polar hood.

Ithaca Chasma, a long series of scarps or cliffs on Tethys, can be seen
faintly running north-south on that moon. See
[PIA10460](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10460) to learn more.

This view looks toward the side of Titan (3,200 miles or 5,150 kilometers
across) facing away from Saturn and the side of Tethys (660 miles or 1,062
kilometers across) facing Saturn. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit
side of the rings from just above the ring plane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 21, 2011, at a distance of approximately
1.4 million miles (2.3 million kilometers) from Titan and 2.4 million miles
(3.8 million kilometers) from Tethys. Image scale is 9 miles (14 kilometers)
per pixel on Titan and 18 miles (27 kilometers) per pixel on Tethys.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
