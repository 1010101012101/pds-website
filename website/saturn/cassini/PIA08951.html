**Caption:**

Janus floats above the meandering clouds of Saturn. A few of the large 
craters on the moon are just visible.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18 
degrees above the ringplane. Saturn's narrow F ring and outer A ring are 
pictured in the upper right.

Janus is 181 kilometers (113 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on April 13, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 
million kilometers (1 million miles) from Janus. Image scale is 10 
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
