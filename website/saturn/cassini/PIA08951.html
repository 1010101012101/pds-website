Janus floats above the meandering clouds of Saturn. A few of the large craters
on the moon are just visible.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18
degrees above the ringplane. Saturn's narrow F ring and outer A ring are
pictured in the upper right.

Janus is 181 kilometers (113 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 13, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1 million miles) from Janus. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
