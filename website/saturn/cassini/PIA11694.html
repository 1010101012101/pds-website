Sunlight passing through the Cassini Division between Saturn's A and B rings
sweeps across and illuminates the surface of the moon Janus in this movie
captured shortly after Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanied equinox lowered the sun's
angle to the ring plane, significantly darkened the rings, caused out-of-plane
structures to look anomalously bright and threw shadows across the rings. As
this movie shows, the equinox period also allowed the rings to cast shadows on
the moons. These scenes were possible only during the few months before and
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before
and after equinox, cameras on NASA's Cassini spacecraft spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11697](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11697)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the trailing hemisphere of Janus (179 kilometers, 111
miles across). North on Janus is up and rotated 8 degrees to the right.

The movie is a concatenation of 12 still images. The images were obtained in
visible light with Cassini's narrow-angle camera on Aug. 27, 2009. The view
was acquired at a distance of approximately 268,000 kilometers (167,000 miles)
from Janus and at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 25 degrees. Image
scale is 2 kilometers (5,271 feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
