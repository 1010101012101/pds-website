As seen from the side not illuminated by the Sun, Saturn's thinner rings are
highlighted in shades of brown and gold, contrasting with the more neutral
appearance of the icy moon Tethys. The A ring and Cassini Division are
separated by the optically thick B ring, which does not permit sunlight to
penetrate and appears as the broad, dark lane between them in this view.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or
665 miles across). North is up and rotated 35 degrees to the right.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 2 degrees
above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The view was acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Oct. 29, 2007, at a distance of
approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Tethys and at a
Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 21 degrees. Image scale is 12
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
