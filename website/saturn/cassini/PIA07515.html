This spectacular and disorienting maze of lines is a Cassini portrait of the
gas giant Saturn, its rings and its small, icy moon Mimas. The rings cast dark
shadows across Saturn's northern hemisphere, creating a photonegative effect:
dark sections are dense and block the Sun, while bright sections are less
dense areas or gaps in the rings, which are more transparent to sunlight.

Saturn's moon Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) is seen here against
the backdrop created by the shadow of the dense B ring. Above Mimas and the B
ring shadow can be seen the broad gap of the Cassini Division. The actual
Cassini Division, which divides the A and B rings, is visible about one-third
of the way up from the bottom of the image.

This view was obtained in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Oct. 15, 2004, at a distance of approximately 4.7 million
kilometers (2.9 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 28 kilometers
(17 miles) per pixel.

This image was taken from beneath the plane of Saturn's rings. It is similar
to the serene portrait provided by Cassini in a natural color view from
November, 2004 (see
[PIA06142](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06142)).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
