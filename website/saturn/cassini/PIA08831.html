**Caption:**

Old spokes never die, they just fade away. That is the current thinking of
scientists who study these ephemeral features in Saturn's rings.

This "difference image" is actually a composite of two images of the B
ring, taken about 45 seconds apart. The view illustrates how the several
spokes imaged here moved between exposures. The spokes were bright against
the rings in both original images, but the brightness of the earlier image
was reversed so that the spoke movement is easy to discern. The "dark"
image of the spokes was taken first, thus rotation in the scene is toward
the bottom.

The topmost spoke is about 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles) long and about
600 kilometers (370 miles) wide. The separation between the top spoke and
the bottom one is about 8,500 kilometers (5,300 miles).

The available evidence seems to indicate that spokes are radial when
generated and then shear out as they orbit the planet, eventually
dispersing and fading out after about three and one-half hours.

All of these spokes are nearly radial on their trailing (top) edges,
except for the thin, bottommost spoke. That spoke and the wedge-shaped one
above it have a shear of about 38 degrees, meaning they have an age of
about two and one-quarter hours, assuming they were first radial and then
sheared their entire lives.

The faint horizontal banding in the image is due to "noise" in the
spacecraft electronics that was picked up by the camera system and
enhanced by the processing technique used here.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 32 degrees
above the ringplane.

The two images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera
on Nov. 1, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 162 degrees. Image scale on the sky at the distance of Saturn is
10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.
