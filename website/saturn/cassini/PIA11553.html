The moon Prometheus casts a shadow on the thin F ring marked with streamer-
channels created by the moon in this image taken as Saturn approaches its
August 2009 equinox.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across)
periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See
[PIA10461](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10461) and
[PIA10593](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10593) to learn more.
To watch a movie of this process, see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 2009
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies
of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 52
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 15, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 85 degrees.
Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
