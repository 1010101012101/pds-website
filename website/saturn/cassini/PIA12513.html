**Caption:**

Saturn, stately and resplendent in this natural color view, dwarfs the icy 
moon Rhea.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) orbits beyond the rings on 
the right of the image. The moon Tethys is not shown here, but its shadow 
is visible on the planet on the left of the image. This view looks toward 
the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 4, 2009 at a distance of 
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, 
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were 
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is 
based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
