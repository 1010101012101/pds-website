Saturn, stately and resplendent in this natural color view, dwarfs the icy
moon Rhea.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) orbits beyond the rings on the
right of the image. The moon Tethys is not shown here, but its shadow is
visible on the planet on the left of the image. This view looks toward the
northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 4, 2009 at a distance of approximately
1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 72
kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
