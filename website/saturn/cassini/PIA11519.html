**Caption:**

In the lower center of this image, the Cassini spacecraft captures an 
intriguing feature of Saturn's tenuous F ring.

To learn more about this ring, see [PIA07717](PIA07717.html) and [PIA08397](PIA08397.html). 

Several background stars are visible in this image. This view looks toward 
the sunlit side of the rings from about 64 degrees below the ringplane. 
The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on March 23, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 905,000 kilometers (562,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 107 degrees. Image scale is 5 
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
