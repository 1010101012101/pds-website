In the lower center of this image, the Cassini spacecraft captures an
intriguing feature of Saturn's tenuous F ring.

To learn more about this ring, see
[PIA07717](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07717) and
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

Several background stars are visible in this image. This view looks toward the
sunlit side of the rings from about 64 degrees below the ringplane. The image
was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
March 23, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 905,000
kilometers (562,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 107 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
