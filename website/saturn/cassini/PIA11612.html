**Caption:**

About a month after Saturn's August 2009 equinox, shadows continue to
grace the planet's rings.

Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) orbits in the Encke Gap, which
runs through the center of the image. The small moon can be seen casting a
faint, narrow shadow on the A ring above and to the right of the center of
the image.

On the far left of the image, a small vertical structure in the thin F
ring can be seen casting a shadow on the ring.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) can be seen in the bottom
right of the image. Bright specks in the image are stars.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 6
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 117 degrees. Image
scale is 15 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
