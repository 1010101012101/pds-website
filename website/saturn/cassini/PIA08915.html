**Caption:**

The high northern latitudes on Enceladus show little detail from
Cassini's distant vantage point, nearly 50 degrees above the moon's
equator.

The plume of icy material that jets from the south pole of Enceladus (505
kilometers, or 314 miles across) is not visible in this viewing geometry.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 26, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Enceladus and at a
Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 95 degrees. Scale in the
original image was 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel. The image was
contrast enhanced and magnified by a factor of two.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
