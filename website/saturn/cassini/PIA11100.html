Cassini images reveal the existence of a faint arc of material orbiting with
Saturn's small moon Anthe.

The moon is moving in a counterclockwise direction in this perspective, and is
about to reach the ansa--the point of maximum elongation--as seen by the
viewer, in its curving path around Saturn.

In this image, most of the visible material in the arc lies ahead of Anthe (2
kilometers, or 1 mile across) in its orbit. However, over time the moon drifts
slowly back and forth with respect to the arc. Also ahead of the moon is a
dark channel where the arc appears split into two strands, and these then
merge farther around the orbital path. The arc extends over about 20 degrees
in longitude (about 5.5 percent of Anthe's orbit) and appears to be associated
with a gravitational resonance caused by Mimas. Micrometeoroid impacts on
Anthe are the likely source of the arc material. The orbit of Anthe lies
between the larger moons Mimas and Enceladus. Anthe shares this region with
two other small moons, Pallene (4 kilometers, or 3 miles across) and Methone
(3 kilometers, or 2 miles across). Methone also possesses an arc (see
[PIA11102](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11102)), while Pallene
is known to orbit within a faint, complete ring of its own (see
[PIA08328](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08328)).

Cassini imaging scientists believe the process that maintains the Anthe and
Methone arcs is similar to that which maintains the arc in the G ring (see
[PIA08327](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08327)). This view
looks toward the un-illuminated side of the rings from about 3 degrees above
the ringplane. The view has been rotated so that Saturn's north pole would
point upward. The general brightness of the image (along with the faint
horizontal and vertical banding pattern) results from the long exposure time
of 32 seconds required to capture the extremely faint ring arc and the
processing needed to enhance its visibility (which also enhances the digital
background noise in the image). The image was digitally processed to remove
most of the background noise. The long exposure also produced star trails in
the background. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 4, 2008. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Anthe
and at a sun-Anthe-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 23 degrees. Image scale is 7
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
