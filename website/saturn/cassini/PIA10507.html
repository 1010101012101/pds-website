**Caption:**

Saturn's battered moon Janus wears the record of its long history of 
impacts.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) orbits just beyond the outer 
reaches of Saturn's A and F rings, which are seen here.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 4 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 28, 2008. The view was 
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (703,000 
miles) from Janus and at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 28 
degrees. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
