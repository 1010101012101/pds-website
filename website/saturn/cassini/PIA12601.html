Saturn's moon Pan, orbiting in the Encke Gap near the top of the image, casts
a short shadow on the A ring in this image taken about six months after the
planet's August 2009 equinox.

Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) also creates dark wakes, which can
faintly be seen here immediately interior to the inner edge of the Encke Gap.
See [PIA07537](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07537) for another
example.

The shadow of the planet is cast diagonally across the rings at the top of the
image. Five background stars are visible.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 17 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 8, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
