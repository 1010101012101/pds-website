Saturn shows white feathery clouds near 45 degrees south latitude. Note the
disturbances around the eastern edge of the south polar collar. The moon Mimas
is visible above the rings at the upper right. The image was taken with the
Cassini narrow angle camera in the near infrared on May 10, 2004, at a
distance of 27.2 million kilometers (16.9 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles) per pixel. Contrast in the image was
enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
