**Caption:**

Saturn shows white feathery clouds near 45 degrees south latitude. Note
the disturbances around the eastern edge of the south polar collar. The
moon Mimas is visible above the rings at the upper right. The image was
taken with the Cassini narrow angle camera in the near infrared on May
10, 2004, at a distance of 27.2 million kilometers (16.9 million miles)
from Saturn. Image scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles) per pixel. Contrast
in the image was enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
