**Caption:**

The faint G ring surrounding Saturn offers up a glimpse of its newfound 
tiny moonlet.

The moonlet is near the center of this image. A long exposure of 46 
seconds was required to capture the light from this tiny object and G 
ring, so the moonlet and a few stars have been smeared by motion, the 
stars showing up as short diagonal dashes. The moonlet has also been 
smeared and appears to be a short vertical dash that is aligned with the 
ring.

In August 2008 Cassini scientists spotted this moonlet, dubbed S/2008 S 1. 
It orbits in an arc, or partial ring, within the G ring. Imaging team 
scientists estimated the moonlet's diameter at about half a kilometer 
(one-third mile). For earlier images of this moonlet, see [PIA11148](PIA11148.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 14 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 20, 2009. The view was 
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
