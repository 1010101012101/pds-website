**Caption:**

This perspective, from just beneath Saturn's ringplane, gives the rings a
pointed appearance and captures a few clumps at the edge of the narrow F
ring. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, 665 miles across) floats peacefully in the
distance.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 12, 2006, at a distance of approximately 4.1
million kilometers (2.6 million miles) from Tethys. The image scale is 25
kilometers (16 miles) per pixel on Tethys.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
