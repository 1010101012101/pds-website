**Caption:**

The shadow of the moon Enceladus appears on Saturn just south of the thin 
shadow of the planet's rings in this image captured shortly after Saturn's August 
2009 equinox.

Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) is not shown, but Mimas (396 
kilometers, or 246 miles across) is visible outside the rings below the middle 
of the image.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's 
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-plane 
structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings. These 
scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's 
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after 
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of 
some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the shadows of newly 
revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 11 degrees 
above the ringplane. The rings have been brightened relative to the planet to 
enhance visibility.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle 
camera on Aug. 19, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 
2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, 
or phase, angle of 115 degrees. Image scale is 132 kilometers (82 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
