The colorful globe of Saturn's largest moon, Titan, passes in front of the
planet and its rings in this true color snapshot from NASA's Cassini
spacecraft.

The north polar hood can be seen on Titan (3,200 miles or 5,150 kilometers
across) and appears as a detached layer at the top of the moon here. See
[PIA08137](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08137) and
[PIA09739](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09739) to learn more
about Titan's atmosphere and the north polar hood.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ring plane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 21, 2011, at a distance of approximately
1.4 million miles (2.3 million kilometers) from Titan. Image scale is 9 miles
(14 kilometers) per pixel on Titan.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
