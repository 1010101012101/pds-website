**Caption:**

Nine days before it entered orbit, Cassini spacecraft captured this
exquisite natural color view of Saturn's rings. The images that make up
this composition were obtained from Cassini's vantage point beneath the
ring plane with the narrow angle camera on June 21, 2004, at a distance
of 6.4 million kilometers (4 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale
is 38 kilometers (23 miles) per pixel.

The brightest part of the rings, curving from the upper right to the
lower left in the image, is the B ring. Many bands throughout the B ring
have a pronounced sandy color. Other color variations across the rings
can be seen. Color variations in Saturn's rings have previously been seen
in Voyager and Hubble Space Telescope images. Cassini's images show that
color variations in the rings are more pronounced in this viewing geometry
than they are when seen from Earth.

Saturn's rings are made primarily of water ice. Since pure water ice is
white, it is believed that different colors in the rings reflect different
amounts of contamination by other materials such as rock or carbon
compounds. In conjunction with information from other Cassini instruments,
Cassini images will help scientists determine the composition of different
parts of Saturn's ring system.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
