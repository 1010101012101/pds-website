**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft took a series of images on Sept. 9, 2006 as it 
watched the bright red giant star Aldebaran slip behind Saturn's rings. 
This type of observation is known as a stellar occultation and uses a star 
whose brightness is well known. As Cassini watches the rings pass in front 
of the star, the star's light fluctuates, providing information about the 
concentrations of ring particles within the various radial features in the 
rings.

This view shows the Encke Gap (325 kilometers, or 200 miles wide) and the 
faint ringlets which share the gap with the embedded moon Pan. The view 
looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 19 degrees below the 
ringplane. Bright Aldebaran is overexposed, creating thin vertical lines 
on its image.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 9, 2006 at a distance of approximately 
359,000 kilometers (233,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale on the sky at 
the distance of Saturn is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
