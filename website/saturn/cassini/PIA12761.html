The right-hand limb of Saturn's moon Mimas appears flattened as Herschel
Crater is viewed edge-on in this Cassini spacecraft image. The planet's rings
are in the background.

Herschel Crater is 130 kilometers (81 miles) wide and located on the moon's
leading hemisphere. See
[PIA12568](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12568) for a straight-
on view of the crater.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246
miles across). North on Mimas is up and rotated 16 degrees to the left. This
view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from just
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 31, 2011. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
260,000 kilometers (161,000 miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 9 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
