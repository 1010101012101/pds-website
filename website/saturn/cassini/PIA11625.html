**Caption:**

The small moon Pan casts a short shadow on Saturn's A ring in this image 
taken as the planet approached its August 2009 equinox.

Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) orbits in the Encke Gap of the A 
ring. The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the 
sun's angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes 
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across 
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and 
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. 
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the 
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the 
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves 
(see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from 
about 53 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on June 1, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance 
of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Pan. 
Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
