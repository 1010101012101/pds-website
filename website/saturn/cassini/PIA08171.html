**Caption:**

This splendid view offers a detailed look at the faint rings within the
Cassini Division as well as a rare glimpse of the Keeler gap moon,
Daphnis. The small, ring embedded moon is a bright unresolved speck above
center, near the outer edge of the A ring.

Discovered in Cassini images in 2005, Daphnis is a mere 7 kilometers (4
miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on March 20, 2006, at a distance of approximately
483,000 kilometers (300,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale on the
sky at the distance of Daphnis is about 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
