This map of the south polar region of Saturn's moon Enceladus shows the
correlation between jet sources identified in Cassini imaging data and hot
spots on the surface located by the composite infrared spectrometer
instrument.

To identify jet source locations on the surface, imaging scientists carefully
measured the locations and orientations of individual jets observed along the
moon's limb in Cassini images taken from multiple viewing angles (see
[PIA08386](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08386)). For each jet
measurement, the researchers then computed a curve, or ground track, on the
surface of Enceladus along which that jet might lie. The ground tracks from
all of the measurements made in the various images produced many intersections
on this map. By considering the jet directions at every possible intersection,
the researchers isolated eight clusters of ground track intersections as jet
sources.

The eight identified jet source locations are labeled with yellow roman
numerals. Composite infrared spectrometer hot spots are red boxes labeled with
green capital letters. The line-of-sight intersections indicating the
measurements of each source in individual images are shown as colored
diamonds. White circles indicate the uncertainty in the locations of those
sets of intersections.

The map is a polar stereographic projection of Cassini imaging data. The four
tiger stripe fractures, or sulci, are labeled here. The south pole is dead
center on the map. Key longitudes are also labeled around the perimeter of the
map.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
