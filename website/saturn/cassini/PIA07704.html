**Caption:**

This fortunate view sights along Saturn's ringplane to capture three moons
aligned in a row: Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across) at left,
Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) at center and Epimetheus
(116 kilometers, or 72 miles across) at right.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 2, 2006, at a distance of approximately 2.8
million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 19
kilometers (12 miles) per pixel on Dione, and about 17 kilometers (11
miles) per pixel on Prometheus and Epimetheus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
