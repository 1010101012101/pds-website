Wispy fingers of bright, icy material reach tens of thousands of kilometers
outward from Saturn's moon Enceladus into the E ring, while the moon's active
south polar jets continue to fire away.

This astonishing, never-before-seen structure is made visible with the sun
almost directly behind the Saturn system from Cassini's vantage point. The
sun-Enceladus-spacecraft angle here is 175 degrees, a viewing geometry in
which structures made of tiny particles brighten substantially.

These features are very likely the result of particles injected into Saturn
orbit by the Enceladus geysers: Those injected in the direction of the moon's
orbital motion end up on larger, slower orbits and trail Enceladus in its
orbit, and those injected into the opposite direction end up smaller, faster
orbits and lead Enceladus. (Orbital motion is counter-clockwise.) In addition,
the configuration of wisps may hint at an interaction between Saturn's
magnetosphere and the torrent of particles issuing from Enceladus.

In addition to the wisps, another unexpected detail is the dark gore in the
center of the ring, following the moon in its orbit, likely brought about by
the sweeping action of Enceladus as it orbits in the center of the E ring.

The view looks down onto Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) from
about 15 degrees above the ringplane. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles
across) is visible to the left of Enceladus.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 15, 2006, at a distance of approximately 2.1 million
kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Enceladus. Image scale is 128 kilometers
(80 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
