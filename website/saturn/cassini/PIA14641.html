Saturn's small moon Daphnis is caught in the act of raising waves on the edges
of the Keeler gap, which is the thin dark band in the left half of the image.
Waves like these allow scientists to locate small moons in gaps and measure
their masses.

For more on Daphnis (5 miles, or 8 kilometers across) and the Keeler gap, see
[PIA11655](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11655) and
[PIA06238](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06238).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 13 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 14, 2012.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 483,000 miles (778,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 4
degrees. Image scale is 3 miles (4 kilometers) per pixel. The F ring has been
brightened by a factor of 1.5 relative to the main rings to enhance
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
