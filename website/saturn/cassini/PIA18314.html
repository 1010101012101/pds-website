From a distance Saturn seems to exude an aura of serenity and peace.

In spite of this appearance, Saturn is an active and dynamic world. Its
atmosphere is a fast-moving and turbulent place with wind speeds in excess of
1,100 miles per hour (1,800 km per hour) in places. The lack of a solid
surface to create drag means that there are fewer features to slow down the
wind than on a planet like Earth.

Mimas, to the upper-right of Saturn, has been brightened by a factor of 2 for
visibility.

In this view, Cassini was at a subspacecraft latitude of 19 degrees North. The
image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 4, 2015
using a spectral filter centered at 752 nanometers, in the near-infrared
portion of the spectrum.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.6 million miles (2.5
million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 96 miles (150 kilometers) per
pixel.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
