**Caption:**

Seen from the unlit side of Saturn's A ring, the shadow of the moon Janus 
is cast across the Encke Gap.

The varying darkness of the shadow is due to varying particle density 
across the ring. To learn more and to watch a movie of a moon's shadow 
moving across the unlit side of the rings, see [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 
2009 equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's 
equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible 
only during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs 
only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time 
and to see a movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html).

Janus is not shown in this image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 28, 2009. The view was 
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 54 
degrees. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.
