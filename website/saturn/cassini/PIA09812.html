Saturn's two ring-embedded moons are pictured here, along with clearly visible
signs of their perturbing effects on the ring edges that border the gaps they
inhabit.

These ripples along the ring edges arise when the perturbing moon passes by,
creating leading wakes in the faster moving ring material interior to the moon
and trailing wakes as it passes the slower moving ring material beyond the
moon. Being larger than Daphnis, Pan creates correspondingly larger wakes.

Daphnis (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across) is seen in the Keeler Gap at left,
and Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across) appears near center in the Encke
Gap.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 10
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 1, 2007. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (819,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
