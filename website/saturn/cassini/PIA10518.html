**Caption:**

The ever-changing F ring appears as wisps of smoke in this image taken
downstream of the shepherd moon, Prometheus.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 23, 2008 at a distance of approximately
437,000 kilometers (272,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 89 degrees. Image scale is 2
kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
