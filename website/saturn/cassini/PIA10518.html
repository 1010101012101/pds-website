The ever-changing F ring appears as wisps of smoke in this image taken
downstream of the shepherd moon, Prometheus.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 23, 2008 at a distance of approximately 437,000 kilometers
(272,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
89 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
