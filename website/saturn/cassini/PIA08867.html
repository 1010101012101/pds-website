**Caption:**

Epimetheus is a lonely dot beyond Saturn's rings. The little moon appears 
at lower left, outside the narrow F ring.

Several very faint spokes lurk in the B ring, at right.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 49 degrees 
above the ringplane. Epimetheus is 116 kilometers (72 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Dec. 17, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.1 
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 63 
kilometers (39 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
