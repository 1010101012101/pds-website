Vertical structures in the variable outer edge of Saturn's B ring cast shadows
in these two images captured by NASA's Cassini spacecraft shortly after the
planet's August 2009 northern vernal equinox.

In these two images, Cassini's narrow angle camera captured a 20,000
-kilometer-long (12,000-mile-long) section arcing along the outer edge of the
B ring in Saturn's rings. This particular section of the ring is known to be
the site of vertical structures as tall as 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles). See
[PIA11668](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11668) to learn more.

The B ring is shown at the top of both frames. The Cassini Division, a low-
density ring region that separates the B ring from the A ring, runs from the
bottom right to the upper left of the images. The A ring is at the bottom.

Cassini imaging scientists have concluded that this region and another in this
vicinity are the sites of massive bodies, or moonlets, embedded near the
ring's edge but independently orbiting Saturn. In the particular region shown
in this image, the moonlets are likely big enough to cause ring material
streaming past them to be excessively compressed and thrown vertically as a
result.

This interpretation is supported by Cassini's previous discovery of a moonlet
embedded in this region of the B ring (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)). The imaged
moonlet, whose size is estimated at 300 meters (1,000 feet) across, was found
only because it was betrayed by the shadow it cast during Saturn's August 2009
equinox period.

This image and others like it are only possible around the time of Saturn's
equinox which occurs every half-Saturn-year (equivalent to about 15 Earth
years). The illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ring plane and causes structures jutting out of the plane to cast
long shadows across the rings. Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11654](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11654)).

Both panels were re-projected to the same viewing geometry. The right-hand
panel is a mosaic of two images. The images of the right-hand panel were taken
in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 19,
2009. Two stars are visible.

The left-hand panel was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 16, 2009. One star is visible.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 11
degrees above the ring plane at a distance of approximately 2.3 million
kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 13 kilometers (8
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
