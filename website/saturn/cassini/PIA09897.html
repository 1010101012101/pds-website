Two of Saturn's ring moons draw close momentarily, before the inner of the
pair moves off alone.

Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across, at center right) passes Prometheus
(86 kilometers, or 53 miles across, at center left) about once a month, then
slowly and steadily pulls ahead of its slower moving sibling.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 23
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 6, 2008. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (975,000 miles) from
Atlas. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
