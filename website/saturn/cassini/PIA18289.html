A new day dawns on Saturn as the part of the planet seen here emerges once
more into the Sun's light.

With an estimated rotation period of 10 hours and 40 minutes, Saturn's days
and nights are much shorter than those on Earth.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 25 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Aug. 23, 2014 using a spectral filter which preferentially
admits wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 939 nanometers.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.8
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 127 degrees. Image scale is 67 miles (108 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
