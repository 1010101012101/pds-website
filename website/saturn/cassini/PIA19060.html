Recent research suggests much of the eruption activity on the surface of
Saturn's moon Enceladus could be in the form of broad, curtain-like eruptions,
rather than discrete jets.

This simulation, which begins and ends with a real image from NASA's Cassini
spacecraft, demonstrates how the appearance of discrete jets could be an
optical illusion that varies based on viewing geometry. As the perspective
rotates around Enceladus' south pole, "phantom" jets seem to appear and
disappear.

The researchers involved in the study think some prominent jets likely are
what they appear to be -- meaning individual, discrete sources -- but most of
the activity seen in the images can be explained as curtain eruptions.

See [PIA19061](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA19061) for a
related image.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
