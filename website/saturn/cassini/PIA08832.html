**Caption:**

Crescent Saturn is girded by its dark belt of ice in this marvelous 
portrait of the planet and the "dark" side of its rings. This is the unlit 
side of the rings, where sunlight filters feebly through the lanes of 
particles.

This view is a mosaic of two images. No data were taken to fill in the 
missing block in the upper left quadrant, and the inner part of the rings 
is cut off there.

This view was acquired from about 4 degrees above the ringplane.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera 
using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light 
centered at 727 nanometers on Nov. 6, 2006. Cassini was then at a distance 
of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn and at 
a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 148 degrees. Image scale is 77 
kilometers (48 miles) per pixel.
