People with similar jobs or interests hold conventions and meetings, so why
shouldn't moons? Pandora, Prometheus, and Pan -- seen here, from right to left
-- also appear to be holding some sort of convention in this image.

Some moons control the structure of nearby rings via gravitational "tugs." The
cumulative effect of the moon's tugs on the ring particles can keep the rings'
edges from spreading out as they are naturally inclined to do, much like
shepherds control their flock. Pan is a prototypical shepherding moon, shaping
and controlling the locations of the inner and outer edges of the Encke gap
through a mechanism suggested in 1978 to explain the narrow Uranian rings.
However, though Prometheus and Pandora have historically been called "the F
ring shepherd moons" due to their close proximity to the ring, it has long
been known that the standard shepherding mechanism that works so well for Pan
does not apply to these two moons.

The mechanism for keeping the F ring narrow, and the roles played -- if at all
-- by Prometheus and Pandora in the F ring's configuration are not well
understood. This is an ongoing topic for study by Cassini scientists.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 29 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 2, 2015.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.6 million miles (2.6
million kilometers) from the rings and at a Sun-ring-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 86 degrees. Image scale is 10 miles (15 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
