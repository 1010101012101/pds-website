**Caption:**

The moon Janus casts a shadow on Saturn's A ring but misses the thin F 
ring in this image captured as the planet approached its August 2009 
equinox.

The moon itself is not pictured, and the shadow has missed the thin F ring 
because the moon has inclined orbit. See [PIA11543](PIA11543.html) for a similar image of Pandora's 
shadow. Janus' shadow here reaches past the Encke Gap of the A ring. The 
Cassini Division runs from the middle right to the top left of the image. 
The image has been cropped and zoomed-in by a factor of two.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's 
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes 
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across 
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and 
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. 
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the 
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the 
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from 
about 52 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on May 28, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of 
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 53 degrees. Image scale is 77 
kilometers (48 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages  
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The  
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and  
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space  
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
