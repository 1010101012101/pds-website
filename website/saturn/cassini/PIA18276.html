Saturn appears to Cassini's cameras as a thin, sunlit crescent in this
unearthly view. Citizens of Earth, being so much closer to the Sun than
Saturn, never get to enjoy a view of Saturn like this without the aid of our
robot envoys.

Parts of the night side of Saturn show faint illumination due to light
reflected off the rings back onto the planet, an effect dubbed "ringshine."
This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 43
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in green light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug. 4, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.2 million miles (2
million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 75 miles (120 kilometers) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
