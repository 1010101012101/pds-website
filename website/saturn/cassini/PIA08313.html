**Caption:**

The spoke-producing region of the B ring displays fine-scale asymmetry in
the azimuthal direction -- the direction along which the ring particles
orbit Saturn -- from upper left to lower right across the image.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 14 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 12, 2006 at a distance of approximately
429,000 kilometers (267,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 3
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
