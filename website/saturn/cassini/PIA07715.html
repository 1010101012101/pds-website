**Caption:**

This view is part of a montage of images from the NASA Cassini and Voyager 
missions shown in [PIA07714](PIA07714.html). The inset image from the montage is presented 
here by itself and in its original 
orientation.

Cassini has observed the D-ring at much higher resolution than was 
possible for Voyager, revealing surprising fine-scale structures. This 
narrow-angle camera image was taken on May 21, 2005, and shows the region 
between the D ring feature named D73 and the inner edge of the C-ring at 
2 kilometer (1 mile) per pixel resolution. This region contains a periodic 
wave-like structure with a wavelength of 30 kilometers (19 miles). The 
faint horizontal bands in the image are instrumental artifacts.

The fine structure in the D-ring (visible here) could be related to 
perturbations from the planet or its magnetic field. The Cassini results 
provide information about the dynamics of ring particles in a new regime 
-- one very close to the planet and sparsely populated by icy particles 
the size of dust.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
