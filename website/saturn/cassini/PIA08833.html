**Caption:**

Streaks of cloud are overlain with graceful ring shadows in this view of 
Saturn's northern latitudes. 

Structure is visible in the shadow of the A ring and Cassini Division, 
which widen at the highest latitudes, near lower right. The lower left 
half of the image does not show the blackness of space, but rather the 
shadow of the B ring, which is perfectly dark here.

The image was acquired from a high inclination above the planet's ring 
plane and looks obliquely toward the limb. (The region shown would be 
downward and to the left of the view presented in [PIA08822](PIA08822.html).)

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera using 
a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 
938 nanometers on Oct. 30, 2006. Cassini was then at a distance of 
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 142 degrees. Image scale is 7 
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
