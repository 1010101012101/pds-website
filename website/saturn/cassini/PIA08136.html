Distant Rhea (right) poses here for the Cassini spacecraft, as Pandora hovers
against Saturn's dark shadow on the rings.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 12, 2006, at a distance of approximately 3.6 million kilometers
(2.3 million miles) from Pandora and 4.3 million kilometers (2.7 million
miles) from Rhea. The image scale is 26 kilometers (16 miles) per pixel on
Rhea.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
