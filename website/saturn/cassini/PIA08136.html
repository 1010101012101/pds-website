**Caption:**

Distant Rhea (right) poses here for the Cassini spacecraft, as Pandora
hovers against Saturn's dark shadow on the rings.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 12, 2006, at a distance of approximately 3.6
million kilometers (2.3 million miles) from Pandora and 4.3 million
kilometers (2.7 million miles) from Rhea. The image scale is 26 kilometers
(16 miles) per pixel on Rhea.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
