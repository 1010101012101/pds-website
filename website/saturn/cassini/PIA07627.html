**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Dione is about to swing around the edge of the thin F ring 
in this color view. More than one thin strand of the F ring's tight spiral 
can be seen here.

The terrain seen on Dione is on the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere. The 
diameter of Dione is 1,126 kilometers (700 miles).

Images taken using infrared, green and ultraviolet spectral filters were 
composited to create this color view. The images were taken with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 20, 2005, at a distance 
of approximately 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Dione and 
at a Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 48 degrees. The image scale 
is 12 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
