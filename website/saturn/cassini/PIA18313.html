Not all of Saturn's rings are created equal: here the C and D rings appear
side-by-side, but the C ring, which occupies the bottom half of this image,
clearly outshines its neighbor.

The D ring appears fainter than the C ring because it is comprised of less
material. However, even rings as thin as the D ring can pose hazards to
spacecraft. Given the high speeds at which Cassini travels, impacts with
particles just fractions of a millimeter in size have the potential to damage
key spacecraft components and instruments. Nonetheless, near the end of
Cassini's mission, navigators plan to thread the spacecraft's orbit through
the narrow region between the D ring and the top of Saturn's atmosphere.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 12
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 11, 2015.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 372,000 miles (599,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 133
degrees. Image scale is 2.2 miles (3.6 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
