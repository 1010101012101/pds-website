**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks beyond Saturn's limb toward the icy face of 
Mimas, the innermost of the planet's major moons.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 3 degrees 
below the ringplane. Mimas is 396 kilometers (246 miles) across.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 4, 2007 at a distance of 
approximately 2.7 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from Saturn and 
2.8 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Mimas. Image scale is 16 
kilometers (10 miles) per pixel on Saturn and 17 kilometers (11 miles) per 
pixel on Mimas.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
