**Caption:**

A string of three of Saturn's icy moons encircles the planet in this
Cassini image.

Visible here are: Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) near lower
right; Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) below the F ring; and
Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) at lower left.

The scene has been brightened to increase the moons' visibility.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on April 25, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.4
million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is
141 kilometers (87 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
