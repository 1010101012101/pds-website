This low-phase Cassini image shows bright areas between dark spokes in
Saturn's B ring.

The dark spokes are not as conspicuous here as the bright regions separating
them. The view was acquired at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 40
degrees. To learn more about these short-lived radial markings, see
[PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 16 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 10, 2009. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 65 kilometers (40 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
