**Caption:**

This low-phase Cassini image shows bright areas between dark spokes in
Saturn's B ring.

The dark spokes are not as conspicuous here as the bright regions
separating them. The view was acquired at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 40 degrees. To learn more about these short-lived radial
markings, see [PIA11144](PIA11144.html).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 16 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 10, 2009. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 65 kilometers (40 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
