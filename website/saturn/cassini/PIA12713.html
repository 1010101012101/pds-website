Saturn's moon Enceladus, imaged at high phase, shows off its spectacular water
ice plumes emanating from its south polar region.

This image was captured at a phase, or sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, angle of 159
degrees so that sunlight would reveal the backlit plumes. See
[PIA11688](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11688) to learn more.

Sunlight brightly illuminates terrain on the left. Light reflected off Saturn
illuminates the rest of the moon more dimly. This view looks toward the
trailing hemisphere of Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across). North
is up.

Background stars, elongated by the movement of the spacecraft during the
exposure, are also visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
431,000 kilometers (268,000 miles) from Enceladus. Image scale is 3 kilometers
(2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
