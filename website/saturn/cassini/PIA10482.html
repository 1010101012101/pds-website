Many of the elegant structures in Saturn's rings result from the influence of
the planet's moons. Seen here at center is the Cassini Division, flanked at
top and bottom by the outer B-ring edge and the inner A-ring edge,
respectively.

The gravitational influence of the moon Mimas is responsible for the Cassini
Division. See [PIA08389](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08389)
for a labeled map of Saturn's rings.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 33
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 2, 2008. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (639,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
