**Caption:**

Many of the elegant structures in Saturn's rings result from the influence
of the planet's moons. Seen here at center is the Cassini Division,
flanked at top and bottom by the outer B-ring edge and the inner A-ring
edge, respectively.

The gravitational influence of the moon Mimas is responsible for the
Cassini Division. See [PIA08389](PIA08389.html) for a labeled map of Saturn's rings.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 33
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 2, 2008. The view was
obtained at a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (639,000
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
