**Caption:**

Multiple tenuous strands flank the brilliant core of Saturn's F ring. 
These delicate, flanking ringlets wind through the F ring, creating a 
tight spiral.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 35 degrees 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 10, 2008. The view was obtained at a 
distance of approximately 262,000 kilometers (163,000 miles) from Saturn 
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 137 degrees. Image 
scale is 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
