Multiple tenuous strands flank the brilliant core of Saturn's F ring. These
delicate, flanking ringlets wind through the F ring, creating a tight spiral.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 35 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 10, 2008. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 262,000 kilometers (163,000 miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 137 degrees. Image scale is 1
kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
