The diminutive moon Mimas can be found hiding in the middle of this view of a
crescent of Saturn bisected by rings.

Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles across) appears as a dark speck just about
the ringplane near the center of the image. This view looks toward the
northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 30,
2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 109 degrees. Image scale is 149
kilometers (93 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
