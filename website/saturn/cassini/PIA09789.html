The spoke-forming region in the outer part of Saturn's B ring is often seen to
exhibit the irregular, patchy appearance around the ring that is visible in
this Cassini view.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 5
degrees above the ringplane. The Cassini Division is visible at lower left.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Oct. 21, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-ring-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 68 degrees. Image scale is about 11
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel in the radial, or outward from Saturn,
direction.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
