**Caption:**

Saturn sits with its attendants in the icy depths of the outer Solar 
System.

Near the edge-on rings, moons visible from left to right: Dione (1,126 
kilometers, or 700 miles across), Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles 
across) and Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across). The ring shadow 
forms a headband crowning Saturn's northern hemisphere.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of 
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Aug. 8, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of 
approximately 4.1 million kilometers (2.6 million miles) from Saturn. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
