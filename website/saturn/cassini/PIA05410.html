**Caption:**

Saturn's magnificent rings show some of their intricate structure in this 
image taken on May 11, 2004, by the Cassini spacecraft's narrow angle 
camera. Although they appear to be solid structures, the rings are 
composed of billions of individual particles, each one orbiting the 
planet on its own path.

Satellites visible in this image: Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles 
across) above the rings, and icy Enceladus (499 kilometers, or 310 miles 
across) below the rings.  The F ring shepherd moons Prometheus and 
Pandora can be seen along Saturn's outermost F ring if the image is 
further contrast enhanced. The image was taken in visible light from a 
distance of 26.3 million kilometers (16.4 million miles) from Saturn. 
The image scale is 158 kilometers (98 miles) per pixel. Contrast in the 
image was enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
