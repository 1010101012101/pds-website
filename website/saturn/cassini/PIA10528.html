**Caption:**

In this image of the F ring, taken shortly after its ring particles 
encountered the shepherd moon Prometheus, the disruption to the ring 
caused by the moon is evident.

The bright core of the ring and its neighboring faint strands show kinks 
where the moon's gravity has altered the orbits of the ring particles.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 23, 2008 at a distance of approximately 
444,000 kilometers (276,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 88 degrees. Image scale is 2 
kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
