**Caption:**

This mosaic of Cassini images, part of a larger mosaic of images captured 
just hours before exact equinox at Saturn, shows that the spiral 
corrugation in the planet's inner rings continues right up to the inner B 
ring - an unexpected result that scientists are working to understand.

The inner B ring boundary is visible on the right.  The C ring's Maxwell 
Gap, demarcated by two bright arcs in this view, is on the left.

The larger mosaic shows a gently undulating pattern stretching from the D 
ring to inner B ring (see [PIA11670](PIA11670.html)).

An earlier mosaic, captured in June, showed the corrugation extending only 
as far as the middle of the C ring (see [PIA11664](PIA11664.html)).

The periodic brightness variations in this corrugation are most likely 
caused by the changing slopes in the rippled ring plane, much like the 
corrugations of a tin roof. Although previous Cassini observations (see [PIA08325](PIA08325.html)) had revealed corrugations in the D  
ring extending over 500 miles (800 kilometers), this image now shows these 
features extending beyond their origin in the D ring for 11,000 miles (17,000 
kilometers) into the C ring. This new imagery supports earlier evidence 
that something happened in the early 1980s to generate this feature.

In 2006, imaging scientists speculated that a collision with a comet or 
asteroid may have disturbed the D ring. That explanation seems less likely 
now that this new image shows the effect spread over a much broader radial 
range, extending completely across the C ring, and scientists are 
continuing to investigate the cause of this disturbance. 

Whatever created the corrugation apparently tilted a vast region of the 
inner rings relative to Saturn's gravitational field in a relatively short 
period of time during the early 1980s. In the intervening years, the 
natural tendency for inclined orbits to systematically and slowly wobble 
at different rates, depending on their distance from Saturn, has created a 
tightly wound spiral corrugation in the ring plane.

This view and others like it are only possible around the time of Saturn's 
equinox which occurs every half-Saturn-year (equivalent to about 15 Earth 
years). Exact equinox is when the sun is directly overhead at the equator. 
The illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's angle 
to the ring plane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes 
out-of-plane structures to cast long shadows across the rings. Cassini's 
cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of Saturn's 
moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the shadows 
of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)). 

This view looks toward the southern side of the rings from about 4 degrees 
below the ring plane. Background stars are visible shining through the 
rings, and the image has not been cleaned to remove cosmic rays, which 
struck the camera's detector during the exposures. 

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 10, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance 
of approximately 888,000 kilometers (552,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 157 degrees. Image scale is 5 
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,  
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages  
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The  
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and  
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space  
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
