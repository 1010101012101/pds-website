Cassini imaging scientists used views like this one to help them identify the
source locations for individual jets spurting ice particles, water vapor and
trace organic compounds from the surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus.

Their study -- published in the Oct. 11, 2007, issue of the journal _Nature_
\-- identifies eight source locations, all on the prominent tiger stripe
fractures, or sulci, in the moon's south polar region. Some of the sources
occur in regions not yet observed by Cassini's composite infrared
spectrometer, and the researchers predict that future Cassini observations of
those locations will find elevated temperatures.

This false-color view was created by combining three clear filter images taken
at nearly the same time as
[PIA07759](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07759). This image
product was then specially processed to enhance the individual jets that
compose the plume.
([PIA07759](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07759) was instead
processed to reveal subtleties in the brightness of the overall plume that
comprises the jets.) Some artifacts due to the processing are present in the
image. The final product was colored as blue for dramatic effect.

The images were acquired with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Nov. 27, 2005 at a distance of approximately 148,000 kilometers (92,000 miles)
from Enceladus and at a sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 161
degrees. Scale in the original images is about 880 meters (0.5 mile) per
pixel. This view has been magnified by a factor of two from the original
images.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
