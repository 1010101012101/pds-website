**Caption:**

This bizarre scene shows the cloud-streaked limb of Saturn in front of the 
planet's B ring. The ring's image is warped near the limb by the diffuse 
gas in Saturn's upper atmosphere.

For additional examples of this effect, see [PIA09810](PIA09810.html), [PIA07521](PIA07521.html) and [PIA06656](PIA06656.html).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 31 degrees 
below the ringplane. North on Saturn is up.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on 
June 24, 2008 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared 
light centered at 750 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of 
approximately 657,000 kilometers (408,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale 
is 4 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
