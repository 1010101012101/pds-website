This bizarre scene shows the cloud-streaked limb of Saturn in front of the
planet's B ring. The ring's image is warped near the limb by the diffuse gas
in Saturn's upper atmosphere.

For additional examples of this effect, see
[PIA09810](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09810),
[PIA07521](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07521) and
[PIA06656](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06656).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 31 degrees
below the ringplane. North on Saturn is up.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June
24, 2008 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 750 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 657,000 kilometers (408,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 4
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
