**Caption:**

Saturn's little moon Atlas orbits Saturn between the outer edge of the A
ring and the fascinating, twisted F ring. This image just barely resolves
the disk of Atlas, and also shows some of the knotted structure for which
the F ring is known. Atlas is 32 kilometers (20 miles) across.

The bright outer edge of the A ring is overexposed here, but farther down
the image several bright ring features can be seen.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on April 25, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.4
million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Atlas and at a
Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 60 degrees. Resolution in the
original image was 14 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.
