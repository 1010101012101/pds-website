**Caption:**

Pandora orbits near a kink in the F ring. Whether it was Prometheus or
Pandora that created the kink is not obvious in this instance.

While not as impressive as the gores which Prometheus induces in the ring,
the gravitational influence of this little moon is still important in
shaping the F ring.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 15, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.026
million kilometers (637,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 38 degrees. Image scale is 6
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
