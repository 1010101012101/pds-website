Half an hour after Prometheus tore into this region of Saturn's F ring, the
Cassini spacecraft snapped this image just as the moon was creating a new
streamer in the ring.The dark pattern shaped like an upside down check mark in
the lower left of the image is Prometheus and its shadow. The potato shaped
moon can just be seen coming back out of the ring.

The moon's handiwork also is apparent in two previous streamer-channel
formations on the right of the image. The darkest streamer-channel stretching
from the top right to the center of the image shows Prometheus' previous
apoapse passage about 15 hours earlier. A fainter, even earlier channel
extends to the edge of the image.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) dips into the inner edge of the
F ring when it reaches apoapse, the moon's farthest orbital point from Saturn.
At apoapse, the moon's gravity pulls particles of the ring outward into a
streamer.

As Prometheus moves onward toward periapse--its orbit's closest point to the
planet--the streamer gets longer. Then, as Prometheus moves back toward
apoapse, the streamer breaks apart which results in a dark channel.

This streamer-channel cycle repeats once every orbit with the streamer-channel
features being streamers during Prometheus periapse and channels during
Prometheus apoapse.

The F ring is overexposed in this image which has been brightened to reveal
the moon.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 14, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 555,000 kilometers (345,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 145 degrees. Image scale is
3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
