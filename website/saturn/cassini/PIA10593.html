**Caption:**

Half an hour after Prometheus tore into this region of Saturn's F ring, 
the Cassini spacecraft snapped this image just as the moon was creating a 
new streamer in the ring.The dark pattern shaped like an upside down check 
mark in the lower left of the image is Prometheus and its shadow. The 
potato shaped moon can just be seen coming back out of the ring.

The moon's handiwork also is apparent in two previous streamer-channel 
formations on the right of the image. The darkest streamer-channel 
stretching from the top right to the center of the image shows Prometheus' 
previous apoapse passage about 15 hours earlier. A fainter, even earlier 
channel extends to the edge of the image. 

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) dips into the inner edge of 
the F ring when it reaches apoapse, the moon's farthest orbital point from 
Saturn. At apoapse, the moon's gravity pulls particles of the ring outward 
into a streamer. 

As Prometheus moves onward toward periapse&mdash;its orbit's closest point 
to the planet&mdash;the streamer gets longer. Then, as Prometheus moves 
back toward apoapse, the streamer breaks apart which results in a dark 
channel. 

This streamer-channel cycle repeats once every orbit with the 
streamer-channel features being streamers during Prometheus periapse and 
channels during Prometheus apoapse.

The F ring is overexposed in this image which has been brightened to 
reveal the moon.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 14, 2009. The view was 
obtained at a distance of approximately 555,000 kilometers (345,000 miles) 
from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 145 
degrees. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
