**Caption:**

Saturn's narrow F ring partly obscures the small moon Epimetheus. Interior
to the F ring is the bright A ring.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across at its widest point) is on
the side of the rings opposite from Cassini.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 2 degrees
below the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 11, 2008. The view was acquired at
a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (766,000 miles) from
Epimetheus. Image scale is 7 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
