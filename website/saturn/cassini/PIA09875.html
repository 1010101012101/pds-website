**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft captured this dramatic view of the unilluminated 
side of Saturn's rings seen at a high phase angle.

Phase angle refers to the angle formed by the Sun, the object being viewed 
(the rings) and the spacecraft. At an angle of zero degrees the Sun is 
directly behind Cassini; at 180 degrees the Sun is directly in front of 
the spacecraft.

Many otherwise faint ring features brighten substantially when viewed at 
high phase. In this image, normally faint regions within the D and inner C 
rings can be seen extending from lower right toward center.

The many small specks in the image were created by cosmic rays striking 
the camera's detector.

This view looks toward the rings from about 2 degrees above the ringplane. 
The planet's shadow darkens the scene at lower right.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Feb. 20, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance of 
approximately 211,000 kilometers (131,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
phase angle of 166 degrees. Image scale on the sky at the distance of 
Saturn is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
