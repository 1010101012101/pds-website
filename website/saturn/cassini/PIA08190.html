**Caption:**

The dark shadows that drape Saturn's northern latitudes are split by three 
familiar bright gaps. From bottom to top, sunlight passes through the 
broad Cassini Division (4,800 kilometers, or 2,980 miles wide), the Encke 
gap (325 kilometers, or 200 miles wide) and (barely visible) the Keeler 
gap (42 kilometers, or 26 miles wide).

It is unlikely that the shadows cast by Saturn's rings have much of an 
effect on the large-scale movements of the atmosphere. The dynamic clouds 
of this gas giant are driven by processes going on much deeper inside the 
planet, where sunlight does not penetrate.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of 
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The image was acquired with the 
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 28, 2006 at a distance of 
approximately 377,000 kilometers (234,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale 
is 19 kilometers (12 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
