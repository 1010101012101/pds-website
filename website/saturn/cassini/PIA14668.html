The shepherd moon Pan orbits Saturn in the Encke gap while the A ring
surrounding the gap displays wave features created by interactions between the
ring particles and Saturnian moons.

Pan (17 miles, or 28 kilometers across) maintains the Encke gap through
gravitational interactions with ring particles. The wave features in the A
ring are generated through interactions between ring particles and moons such
as Pan.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 34 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 11, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 240,000 miles (386,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 111
degrees. Image scale is 1 mile (2 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
