**Caption:**

The tiny moon Pandora appears beyond the bright disk of Saturn's rings.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) orbits outside the F ring and,
in this image, is farther from Cassini than the rings are. This view looks
toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 8, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 2.4 million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Pandora.
Image scale is 14 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate,
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is
based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
