The tiny moon Pandora appears beyond the bright disk of Saturn's rings.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) orbits outside the F ring and, in
this image, is farther from Cassini than the rings are. This view looks toward
the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 8, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.4 million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Pandora. Image scale is 14
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
