Sunlight scatters through Saturn's rings, emerging on the unilluminated side.
Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across, lower right) and Pandora (84
kilometers, or 52 miles across, upper left) are visible here, respectively
internal and external to the narrow F ring.

This view looks toward the rings from about 17 degrees above the ringplane.
The planet's shadow darkens the rings near upper left.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Jan. 20, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 103 kilometers (64 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
