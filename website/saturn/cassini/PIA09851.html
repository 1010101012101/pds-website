**Caption:**

Sunlight scatters through Saturn's rings, emerging on the unilluminated
side. Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across, lower right) and
Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across, upper left) are visible here,
respectively internal and external to the narrow F ring.

This view looks toward the rings from about 17 degrees above the
ringplane. The planet's shadow darkens the rings near upper left.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Jan. 20, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 103 kilometers (64 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
