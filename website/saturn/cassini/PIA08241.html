**Caption:**

This close-up view of the inner A ring shows intriguing variations in
brightness along the direction of ring motion -- from top to bottom. Close
examination reveals dark regions that appear to widen and then narrow, and
thin bright regions that disappear altogether.

Variations in brightness are to be expected in the direction of increasing
orbital distance from Saturn, but variations along the azimuthal (or
circumferential) direction are unusual, as they should be smoothed out
quickly by ring particle motion.

(The faint "doughnut" left of center and the dark area in the lower right
corner are imaging artifacts.)

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on July 23, 2006 at a distance of approximately
285,000 kilometers (177,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 1 kilometer
(0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
