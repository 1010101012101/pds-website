**Caption:**

Undulations mark both sides of the path of Saturn's moon Daphnis through 
the A ring.

Daphnis may be small at only 8 kilometers (5 miles) across, but the moon's 
gravity is great enough, and the Keeler gap in which it resides is narrow 
enough, so that the perturbed particles create the wavelike patterns seen 
here. 

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 47 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 21, 2009. The view was 
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 
miles) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 50 
degrees. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
