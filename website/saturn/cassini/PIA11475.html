Undulations mark both sides of the path of Saturn's moon Daphnis through the A
ring.

Daphnis may be small at only 8 kilometers (5 miles) across, but the moon's
gravity is great enough, and the Keeler gap in which it resides is narrow
enough, so that the perturbed particles create the wavelike patterns seen
here.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 47
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 21, 2009. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from
Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 50 degrees. Image
scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
