The shadow of the moon Mimas is cast on Saturn's outer A ring in this image
which also shows a couple of moons and a collection of stars.

Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across) can be seen in the top right of the
image, between the A ring and thin F ring. Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles
across) can be seen orbiting in the Encke Gap in the lower left of the image.
Mimas is not shown. The bright object between the A ring and F ring on the
left of the image is a star. Other smaller, bright specks in the image are
also background stars.

The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 2009
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies
of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 59
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 30, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (994,000 miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 76 degrees. Image
scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
