This artist's rendering shows a regional cross-section of the ice shell
underlying Enceladus' south polar terrain, illustrating our current knowledge
of the physical and thermal structure and processes ongoing below and at the
surface. Narrow cracks extend upward from the sub-surface sea all the way to
the surface, through both ductile and brittle layers of the ice shell. Liquid
water under pressure fills the cracks, keeping them open even through the
ductile layer and providing a conduit for vapor and sea water to reach the
near-surface. Other processes, such as volatile exsolution of gases, can drive
vapor and water droplets all the way to the surface, forming geysers and
condensing close to the surface, depositing latent heat. This heat is observed
by Cassini's long-wavelength infrared instruments as the small-scale hot spots
(dozens of feet, or tens of meters in size) surrounding each geyser (see
[PIA17189](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17189)).

The subsurface regions immediately surrounding the sea and the cracks bearing
water and vapor are expected to be warm. Regional heating from tidal flexing
is also expected to be present, but is so far undetected.

The ice shell lying above the sea is comparable in thickness to the distance
between the tiger stripe fractures, suggesting that the latter might be cracks
formed in the past when tensional stresses across the region were stronger.

The surface area of the south polar terrain is approximately that of Scotland.

The illustration includes findings reported in a paper by Porco, DiNino, and
Nimmo, and published in the online version of the _Astronomical Journal_ in
July 2014: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45>.

A companion paper, by Nimmo _et al_. is available at:

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
