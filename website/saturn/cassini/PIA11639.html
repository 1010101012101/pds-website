Bright spokes grace Saturn's B ring in this Cassini image.

To learn more about the ghostly radial markings called spokes, see
[PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144) and
[PIA08288](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08288). Spokes appear
bright when they are viewed at phase, or Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, angles higher
than about 45 degrees. The phase angle in this image is 61 degrees.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) orbits between the A ring and
the thin F ring. Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) orbits beyond
the F ring in the top left of the image. The bright dot in the top right is a
star.

Scale in the original image was 71 kilometers (44 miles) per pixel. The image
has been magnified by a factor of 1.5 and contrast-enhanced to aid visibility.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 12
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 22, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.2 million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 61 degrees.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
