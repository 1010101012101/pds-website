Rays of light from the sun have taken many different paths to compose this
glorious image of Saturn and its rings.

This view looks toward the unilluminated (north) side of the rings and, at the
top of the image, the night side of Saturn. Sunlight has been reflected off
the illuminated side of the rings to light the planet's southern hemisphere,
seen here as a bright band of yellow-orange. The northern hemisphere, in the
top left corner of the image, is dimly lit by light diffusely scattered
through the rings. The planet's shadow cuts across the rings, but light
reflected off the southern hemisphere backlights parts of the C ring, making
them visible in silhouette. A similar lighting arrangement can be seen in
[PIA10476](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10476).

Bright points of light in the image are stars occulted by the rings.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 41
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were
acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 20, 2009 at a
distance of approximately 892,000 kilometers (554,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 50 kilometers (31 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
