A stately Saturn poses for a portrait with five of its moons in this
Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera view.

Satellites visible in this image are (clockwise from upper left): Dione
(1,118 kilometers or 695 miles wide), Enceladus (499 kilometers or 310
miles wide), Tethys (1,060 kilometers or 659 miles wide), Mimas (398
kilometers or 247 miles wide) and Rhea (1,528 kilometers or 949 miles
wide).

The image was taken in visible red light on Aug. 1, 2004, at a distance
of 7.8 million kilometers (4.8 million miles) from Saturn. The image
scale is 464 kilometers (288 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
