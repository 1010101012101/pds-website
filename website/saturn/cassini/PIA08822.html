From its unique perspective high above the planet, the Cassini spacecraft
looks down upon Saturn's murky northern hemisphere. The bluish hues seen in
some Cassini views of Saturn's north are notably absent in this viewing
geometry.

The dark side of Saturn's extensive rings is just visible in the top half of
the image.

The view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 44 degrees above
the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 30, 2006 at a distance of approximately
1.4 million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 150 degrees. Image scale is 78 kilometers (49
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
