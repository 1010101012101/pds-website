**Caption:**

From its unique perspective high above the planet, the Cassini spacecraft
looks down upon Saturn's murky northern hemisphere. The bluish hues seen
in some Cassini views of Saturn's north are notably absent in this viewing
geometry.

The dark side of Saturn's extensive rings is just visible in the top half
of the image.

The view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 44 degrees
above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 30, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 1.4 million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 150 degrees. Image scale is 78
kilometers (49 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
