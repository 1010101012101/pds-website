Saturn's F ring often appears to do things other rings don't. In this Cassini
spacecraft image, a strand of ring appears to separate from the core of the
ring as if pulled apart by mysterious forces.

Some ring scientists believe that this feature may be due to repeated
collisions between the F ring and a single small object.

Eight stars are also visible in this image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 49
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Oct. 19, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.2 million miles (1.9
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 120 degrees. Image scale is 6.8 miles (11 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
