NASA's Cassini spacecraft has delivered a glorious view of Saturn, taken while
the spacecraft was in Saturn's shadow. The cameras were turned toward Saturn
and the sun so that the planet and rings are backlit. (The sun is behind the
planet, which is shielding the cameras from direct sunlight.) In addition to
the visual splendor, this special, very-high-phase viewing geometry lets
scientists study ring and atmosphere phenomena not easily seen at a lower
phase.

Since images like this can only be taken while the sun is behind the planet,
this beautiful view is all the more precious for its rarity. The last time
Cassini captured a view like this was in Sept. 2006, when it captured a mosaic
processed to look like natural color, entitled "In Saturn's Shadow" (see [
PIA08329](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08329).) In that mosaic,
planet Earth put in a special appearance, making "In Saturn's Shadow" one of
the most popular Cassini images to date. Earth does not appear in this mosaic
as it is hidden behind the planet.

Also captured in this image are two of Saturn's moons: Enceladus and Tethys.
Both appear on the left side of the planet, below the rings. Enceladus is
closer to the rings; Tethys is below and to the left.

This view looks toward the non-illuminated side of the rings from about 19
degrees below the ring plane.

Images taken using infrared, red and violet spectral filters were combined to
create this enhanced-color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 17, 2012 at a distance of approximately
500,000 miles (800,000 kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale at Saturn is about
30 miles per pixel (50 kilometers per pixel).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
