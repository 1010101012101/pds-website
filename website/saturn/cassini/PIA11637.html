**Caption:**

This Cassini image, which at first appears to show a serene scene, in fact 
reveals dramatic disturbances created in Saturn's A ring by its moon 
Daphnis.

Near the center of the image, tiny Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles 
across) appears as a bright dot in the Keeler Gap near the edge waves it 
has created in the A ring. The moon has an inclined orbit and its 
gravitational pull both perturbs the orbits of the particles of the A ring 
forming the Keeler Gap's edge and sculpts the edge into waves having both 
horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components. Material on the inner 
edge of the gap orbits faster than the moon so that the waves there lead 
the moon in its orbit. Material on the outer edge moves slower than the 
moon, so waves there trail the moon. See [PIA11656](PIA11656.html) to learn more about this process.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) orbits beyond the F ring 
at the bottom of the image. Bright specks in the image are background 
stars.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 
11 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 24, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Daphnis. 
Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
