**Caption:**

This image of the lit face of Saturn's outer, or A, ring was taken by the 
Cassini spacecraft shortly after crossing the ring plane after its orbit 
insertion burn. The image was taken with the narrow angle camera on July 
1, 2004. The rings in the middle of the image are approximately 134,000 
kilometers (83,200 miles) from the center of Saturn. 

The bright wave pattern near the center of the image is caused by the 
overlap between spiral waves of varying particle density generated by 
Saturn's moons Janus and Epimetheus, which share an orbit. These two moon 
orbital periods are very close to each other and, at this location, affect 
ring particle orbits. 

Cleaner spiral patterns caused by single satellites can be seen in other 
images; some of the weaker wave patterns in this image are also spiral 
patterns generated by smaller moons outside the main rings. All these 
spiral waves are of the same nature as the arms of spiral galaxies. The 
finest features which can be discerned (inwards, or to the left, of the 
bright wave feature in the center) are less than one mile across. Their 
cause is not currently known.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
