**Caption:**

Outside the soft edge of Cassini's F ring, Epimetheus and Janus negotiate 
their nearly-shared orbit. The two moons' orbits are typically about 50 
kilometers (30 miles) apart, and the moons actually change orbits every 
few years: one moon becoming the innermost of the pair, the other becoming 
the outermost.

Epimetheus' diameter is 116 kilometers (72 miles). Janus' diameter is 181 
kilometers (113 miles) across. 

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 8, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.5 
million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 
about 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel on the two moons.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
