The Encke Gap in Saturn's A ring is maintained by the presence of the moon
Pan, which shares the gap with several diffuse ringlets. The scalloped
appearance in the inner (left side) edge of the gap results from perturbations
caused by Pan as it sweeps through the 325-kilometer (200-mile) wide lane.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 38 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 10, 2008. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 264,000 kilometers (164,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
