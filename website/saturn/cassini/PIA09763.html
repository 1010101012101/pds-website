**Caption:**

The brilliant B ring ends abruptly at the Huygens Gap -- the broad, dark
band devoid of ring material seen here near left. This gap marks the inner
edge of the Cassini Division, within which the five dim bands at left
reside.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 6 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 29, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 1 million kilometers (637,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
