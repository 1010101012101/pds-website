**Caption:**

A vertically extended structure or object in Saturn's F ring casts a 
shadow long enough to reach the A ring in this Cassini image taken just 
days before planet's August 2009 equinox.

The structure can be seen as a bulge within the bright core of the F ring 
on the left of the image. The structure rises far enough above the ring 
plane for the shadow to be cast across the Roche Division and onto the A 
ring. The shadow is barely visible stretching across the top right 
quadrant of the image. The shadow appears very faint here because this 
view looks toward the unlit side of the rings.

This image and others like it (see [PIA11662](PIA11662.html) and [PIA11663](PIA11663.html)) are only possible 
around the time of Saturn's equinox which occurs every half-Saturn-year 
(equivalent to about 15 Earth years). The illumination geometry that 
accompanies equinox lowers the sun's angle to the ring plane and causes 
out-of-plane structures to cast long shadows across the rings. Exact 
equinox at Saturn begins August 11, 2009, and lasts about four days. 
Shadows have grown longer as those days draw near. Cassini's cameras have 
spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see 
[PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in 
the rings themselves (see [PIA11654](PIA11654.html)).

The A ring in the first (top) image has been brightened relative to F ring 
to enhance visibility of the ring and shadow. The entire image in the 
second (bottom) version has been contrast enhanced. Bright specks in the 
image are background stars.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 28 
degrees above the ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on July 30, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn 
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 96 degrees. Image scale 
is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
