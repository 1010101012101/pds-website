**Caption:**

Subtle features in Saturn's equatorial region and the nearly edge-on 
rings are captured in this view. Images like this will be carefully 
studied to see if changes in wind speed recorded in Hubble Space Telescope 
images are continuing, or whether the winds have reverted to their 
high-speed configuration measured by Voyager in 1981.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on 
Dec. 6, 2005 using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light 
centered at 727 nanometers and at a distance of approximately 3 million 
kilometers (1.9 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 35 
kilometers (22 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
