The fine, dust-sized particles of ice in the F ring and Encke Gap ringlets
appear relatively bright, with the rings positioned almost directly between
the Cassini spacecraft and the Sun.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 2
degrees above the ringplane. At bottom, the planet's shadow casts the rings
into darkness.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Oct. 24, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
298,000 kilometers (185,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 152 degrees. Image scale is 14 kilometers (9 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
