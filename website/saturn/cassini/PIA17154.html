Among the interplay of Saturn's shadow and rings, Mimas, which appears in the
lower-right corner of the image, orbits Saturn as a set of the ever-intriguing
spokes appear in the B ring (just to the right of center).

Scientists expect that spokes will soon cease to form as Saturn approaches
northern equinox. The exact mechanism of spoke formation is still the subject
of debate, but ring scientists do know that spokes no longer appear when the
Sun is higher in Saturn's sky. It is believed that this has to do with the
ability of micron-sized ring grains to maintain an electrical charge and
levitate above the rings, forming spokes. Thus, these may be some of the last
spokes ever imaged by Cassini.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 38
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 22, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.6 million miles (2.6
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 146 degrees. Image scale is 93 miles (150 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
