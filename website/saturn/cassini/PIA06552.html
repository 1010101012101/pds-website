**Caption:**

From beneath the ring plane, the small, irregularly shaped moon Janus
(181 kilometers, or 112 miles, across) can be seen following the orbital
path it shares with slightly smaller Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72
miles, across).

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow angle camera on Nov. 18, 2004, at a distance of approximately 4.7
million kilometers (2.9 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 27
kilometers (17 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate,
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
