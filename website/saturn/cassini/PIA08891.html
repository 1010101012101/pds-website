A bright spoke extends across the unilluminated side of Saturn's B ring about
the same distance as that from London to Cairo. The background ring material
displays some azimuthal (i.e., left to right) asymmetry.

The radial (outward from Saturn) direction is up in this view. A noticeable
kink in the spoke occurs very close to the radius where ring particles orbit
the planet at the speed of Saturn's magnetic field. Such a connection is most
intriguing to scientists studying these ghostly ring phenomena.

If gravity alone were affecting the spoke material, there would be no kink and
the entire spoke would be angled toward right, like the bottom portion. That
it bends to the left above the kink indicates that some other force, possibly
related to the magnetic field, is acting on the spoke material. The shape
might also indicate that the spoke did not form in a radial orientation, thus
challenging scientists' assumptions about these features.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 58 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 23, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers
(1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.
