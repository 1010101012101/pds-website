This illustration depicts the shearing of an initially circular cloud of
debris as a result of the particles in the cloud having differing orbital
speeds around Saturn. The numbers in the lower left of the panels in the still
image show how quickly a cloud can be elongated. After the cloud is formed,
each particle within it follows its own simple orbit. The cloud begins to
elongate as particles closer to the planet orbit at a faster speed than the
particles farther from the planet. Scientists can use the angle the clouds are
canted to infer the time elapsed since it was formed. This method was used to
determine the times of the impacts that created the clouds in Saturn's rings
that were captured by NASA's Cassini spacecraft (see
[PIA14938](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14938) for more
information).
