**Caption:**

The moon Tethys cruises past, in front of Saturn's edge-on rings. The
rings cast threadlike shadows onto the northern hemisphere of the planet.

The large crater Odysseus can be seen on the eastern limb of Tethys (1,071
kilometers, or 665 miles across).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug.
7, 2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of visible light
centered at 619 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 4.1 million kilometers (2.6 million miles) from Saturn.
 Image scale is 49 kilometers (30 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
