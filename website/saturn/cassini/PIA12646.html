Resembling ornaments hanging from Saturn's rings, two moons accent this
portrait of the planet captured by NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The moon Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) is on the right.
Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is on the left. This view looks
toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Nov. 6, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 94 degrees. Image scale is 121
kilometers (75 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
