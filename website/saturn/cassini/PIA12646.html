**Caption:**

Resembling ornaments hanging from Saturn's rings, two moons accent this portrait of the planet captured by NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The moon Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) is on the right. Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is on the left. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 6, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 94 degrees. Image scale is 121 kilometers (75 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
