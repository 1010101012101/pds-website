**Caption:**

A pair of moon shadows and a series of spokes adorn this ring image taken
about a month after Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

The shadow of the moon Janus stretches across the middle of the image. The
shadow of the moon Mimas runs across the bottom, appearing to undulate as
it traverses vertical structures within the rings. Very faint, bright
spokes are barely detectable just above Janus' shadow near the center of
the image. To learn more about spokes, see [PIA11144](PIA11144.html).

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the sunlit, northern side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 8, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 3 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 104 degrees. Image scale is
17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
