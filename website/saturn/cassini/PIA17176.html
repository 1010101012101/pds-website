Winter is approaching in the southern hemisphere of Saturn and with this cold
season has come the familiar blue hue that was present in the northern winter
hemisphere at the start of NASA's Cassini mission. The changing blue hue that
we have learned marks winter at Saturn is likely due to reduction of
ultraviolet sunlight and the haze it produces, making the atmosphere clearer
and increasing the opportunity for Rayleigh scattering (scattering by
molecules and smaller particles) and methane absorption: both processes make
the atmosphere blue. The small black dot seen to the right and up from image
center, within the ring shadows of the A and F rings, is the shadow of the
moon, Prometheus. For an image showing winter in the northern hemisphere see
[PIA08166](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08166).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 44
degrees below the ring plane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were taken
with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 29, 2013.

This view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.003 million miles
(1.615 million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 58 miles (93
kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
