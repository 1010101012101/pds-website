**Caption:**

The shadow of Saturn's largest moon darkens a huge portion of the gas
giant planet.

Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across) is not pictured here, but
its shadow is elongated in the bottom right of the image. This view looks
toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the
ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov.
7, 2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 95 degrees. Image scale is
123 kilometers (76 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
