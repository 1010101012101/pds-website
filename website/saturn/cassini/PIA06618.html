Pandora is seen in this dramatic view, orbiting just beyond the outer edge of
Saturn's F ring. Several bright areas are visible within the F ring. In the
main rings, the Keeler gap and the Encke gap, with a bright ringlet, are also
visible. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers
(746,000 miles) from Pandora and at a Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 108 degrees. The image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
