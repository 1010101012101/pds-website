**Caption:**

Pandora is seen in this dramatic view, orbiting just beyond the outer edge 
of Saturn's F ring. Several bright areas are visible within the F ring. 
In the main rings, the Keeler gap and the Encke gap, with a bright 
ringlet, are also visible. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.2 
million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Pandora and at a 
Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 108 degrees. The image scale 
is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
