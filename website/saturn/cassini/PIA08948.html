**Caption:**

Saturn and its rings manifest a rich interplay between shadow and light.

The rings shine on their unilluminated side by virtue of scattered 
sunlight emerging from its passage through the ringplane. The dense B ring 
does not allow much light to pass through, while the C ring is so sheer as 
to allow the planet to be visible on its other side.

On the planet, shadows cast by the rings arc across the northern 
hemisphere. Saturn's night side is illuminated in the south by light 
reflected from the rings' sunlit face. The night-side northern hemisphere 
is also lit faintly by the face of the rings that is seen in this image. 
The planet's shadow extends across the ringplane toward right.

Several of Saturn's inner moons are visible in this view (from top to 
bottom): Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across), Pandora (84 
kilometers, or 52 miles across), and Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 
miles across).

This view looks toward the rings from about 19 degrees above the 
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on April 13, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.9 
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 107 
kilometers (67 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
