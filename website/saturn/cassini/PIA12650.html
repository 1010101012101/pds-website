Kinky, discontinuous ringlets occupy the Encke Gap in Saturn's A ring in the
middle of this Cassini spacecraft image.

During the planet's August 2009 equinox, parts of these thin ringlets cast
shadows onto the A ring (see
[PIA11676](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11676)).

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 17 degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light
with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 8, 2010. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
