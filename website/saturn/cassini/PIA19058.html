This cutaway view of Saturn's moon Enceladus is an artist's rendering that
depicts possible hydrothermal activity that may be taking place on and under
the seafloor of the moon's subsurface ocean, based on recently published
results from NASA's Cassini mission.

Hydrothermal activity is a process where seawater infiltrates and reacts with
a rocky crust, emerging as a heated, mineral-laden solution. This is a natural
occurrence in Earth's oceans.

Researchers think microscopic grains of rock detected in the Saturn system by
Cassini most likely form when hot water containing dissolved minerals from the
moon's rocky interior travels upward, coming into contact with cooler water.
Temperatures required for the interactions that produce the tiny rock grains
would be at least 194 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius).

On Earth, the most common way to form silica grains of the 6-to-9-nanometer
size found by Cassini is hydrothermal activity involving a specific range of
conditions. Namely, when slightly alkaline, slightly salty water that is
super-saturated with silica undergoes a big drop in temperature.

Gravity science measurements from Cassini also suggest Enceladus' rocky core
is quite porous, which would allow water from the ocean to percolate into the
interior. This would provide a huge surface area where rock and water could
interact.

Cassini first revealed active geology on Enceladus in 2005 with evidence of an
icy spray issuing from the moon's south polar region and higher-than-expected
temperatures in the icy surface there. With its powerful suite of
complementary science instruments, the mission soon revealed a towering plume
of water ice and vapor, salts and organic materials that issues from
relatively warm fractures on the wrinkled surface. Gravity science results
published in 2014 strongly suggested the presence of a 6-mile- (10-kilometer-)
deep ocean beneath an ice shell about 19 to 25 miles (30 to 40 kilometers)
thick.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington.
