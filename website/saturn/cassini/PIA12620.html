Part of the shadow of Saturn's moon Epimetheus appears as if it has been woven
through the planet's rings in this Cassini image taken about a month and a
half before the planet's August 2009 equinox.

Epimetheus itself is not shown, but the moon casts a shadow whose appearance
varies based on the density of particles across the rings. See
[PIA11659](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11659) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660) to learn more.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 45 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 26, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
943,000 kilometers (586,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
