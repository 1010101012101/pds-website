**Caption:**

Both luminous and translucent, the C ring sweeps out of the darkness of
Saturn's shadow and obscures the planet at lower left. The ring is
characterized by broad, isolated bright areas, or "plateaus," surrounded
by fainter material.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 19 degrees
above the ringplane. North on Saturn is up. The dark, inner B ring is seen
at lower right.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Dec. 15, 2006 at a distance of approximately 632,000
kilometers (393,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 56 degrees. Image scale is 34 kilometers (21 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
