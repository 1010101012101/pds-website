The shepherd moons Prometheus and Pandora drive the quirky F ring in its
circuit of Saturn, while Mimas lurks in the distance.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 22
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on May 23, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million
kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about 106
kilometers (66 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
