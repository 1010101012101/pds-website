**Caption:**

The shepherd moons Prometheus and Pandora drive the quirky F ring in its
circuit of Saturn, while Mimas lurks in the distance.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 22
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on May 23, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about
106 kilometers (66 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
