**Caption:**

Saturn's rings appear golden as the planet's shadow drapes across nearly 
the whole span of the rings. In the upper left corner is Saturn's moon 
Mimas. 

This color image was taken on August 15, 2004, with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow angle camera, using the red, green, and blue filters. 
The image was taken 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million miles) from 
Saturn. Contrast has been enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard 
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
