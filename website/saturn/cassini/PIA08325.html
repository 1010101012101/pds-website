**Caption:**

Saturn's D ring--the innermost of the planet's rings -- sports an 
intriguing structure that appears to be a wavy, or "vertically 
corrugated," spiral. This continuously changing ring structure provides 
circumstantial evidence for a possible recent collision event in the 
rings.

Support for this idea comes from the appearance of a structure in the 
outer D-ring that looks, upon close examination, like a series of bright 
ringlets with a regularly spaced interval of about 30 kilometers (19 
miles). When viewed along a line of sight nearly in the ringplane, a 
pattern of brightness reversals is observed: a part of the ring that 
appears bright on the far side of the rings appears dark on the near side 
of the rings, and vice versa (see [PIA08326](PIA08326.html)).

This phenomenon would occur if the region contains a sheet of fine 
material that is vertically corrugated, like a tin roof. In this case, 
variations in brightness would correspond to changing slopes in the 
rippled ring material (see [figure 1](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/figures/PIA08325_fig1.jpg)).

An observation made with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 also saw a 
periodic structure in the outer D ring, but its wavelength was then 60 
kilometers (37 miles). There were insufficient observations to discern 
the spiral nature of the feature. Thus, it appears the wavelength of the 
wavy structure has been decreasing: that is, this feature has been winding 
up like a spring over time.

The rate at which the pattern appears to be winding up is quite close to 
the rate scientists would expect for a vertically corrugated spiraling 
sheet of material at this location in the rings that is responding to 
gravitational forcing from Saturn.

As Cassini imaging scientists extrapolated the spiraling trend backward in 
time, they found that it completely unwound in 1984, leaving only an 
inclined, or tilted, sheet of material. The researchers speculate such an 
inclined sheet may have been produced around that time by the impact of a 
comet or meteoroid into the D ring which kicked out a cloud of fine 
particles that ultimately inherited some of the tilt of the impactor's 
trajectory as it slammed into the rings. Another possibility is that the 
impactor struck an already inclined moonlet, shattered it to bits and the 
debris remained in an inclined orbit.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
