**Caption:**

Brilliant Prometheus pulls at the nearby inner strand of Saturn's F ring.
Gravitational tugs from Prometheus are constantly reshaping this narrow
ring.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across at its widest point) is lit
at right by the Sun and at left by reflected light from Saturn.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 40 degrees
below the ringplane. The glow on the right side of the moon is due to
light scattered within the camera optics. The image was taken in visible
light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 22, 2008.
The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 546,000 kilometers
(339,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 45 degrees. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
