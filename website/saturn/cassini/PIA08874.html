**Caption:**

The dark B ring of Saturn is highlighted here by numerous faint spokes.
The two most prominent spokes are seen below and to the right of center.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 52 degrees
above the ringplane. Saturn's shadow cuts across the rings at lower left.
The pixelated appearance of the shadow edge results from the extreme
enhancement used to make the spokes more visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Jan. 6, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.8
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 104
kilometers (65 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
