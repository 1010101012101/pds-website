**Caption:**

This movie shows a bright arc of material flashing around the edge of 
Saturn's G ring, a tenuous ring outside the main ring system.

The arc is the same feature identified in images of the G ring taken in 
May 2005 (see [PIA07718](PIA07718.html)). Scientists have seen the arc a handful of times 
over the past year, and it always appears to be a few times brighter than 
the rest of the ring and very tightly confined to a narrow strip along the 
inside edge of the G ring.

Imaging team members believe that this feature is long-lived and may be 
held together by resonant interactions with the moon Mimas of the type 
that corral similar ring arcs around Neptune.

The movie consists of 15 frames acquired every half hour over a period of 
seven-and-a-half hours. The version in the lower panel is vertically 
stretched by a factor of five to make the arc easier to see.

The clear-filter images in this movie sequence were acquired by the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 25, 2006, at a distance 
of 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale 
on the sky at the distance of Saturn is about 24 kilometers (15 miles) per 
pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
