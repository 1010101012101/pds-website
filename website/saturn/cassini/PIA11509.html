Fresh from an encounter with Saturn's F ring, the moon Prometheus continues in
its orbit.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across)
periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See
[PIA10461](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10461) and
[PIA10593](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10593) to learn more.
To watch a movie of this process, see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397). Most of
Prometheus is overexposed in this image.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 44 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 24, 2009. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (621,000 miles) from Prometheus
and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 75 degrees. Image scale
is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
