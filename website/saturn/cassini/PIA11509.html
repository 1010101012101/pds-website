**Caption:**

Fresh from an encounter with Saturn's F ring, the moon Prometheus 
continues in its orbit.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles 
across) periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring. See 
[PIA10461](PIA10461.html) and [PIA10593](PIA10593.html) to learn more. To watch a movie of this process, 
see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html). Most of Prometheus is overexposed in this image.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 44 degrees 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 24, 2009. The view was obtained at 
a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (621,000 miles) from 
Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 75 
degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
