**Caption:**

Two pairs of dark spots, or storms, in Saturn's atmosphere squeeze past
each other as they dance around the planet. In this group of four storms,
the top left and lower right storms are fringed with white clouds. The
image was taken with the Cassini narrow angle camera in the near infrared
on May 5, 2004, at a distance of 29.5 million kilometers (18.3 million
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 176 kilometers (109 miles) per pixel.
Contrast in the image was enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
