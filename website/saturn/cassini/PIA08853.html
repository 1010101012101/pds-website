**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft stares toward Saturn through its gauzy veil of
rings. The great ice-particle screen acts like a filter here, attenuating
the glare from the planet and making its high altitude haze easy to see.

The F ring shows off the faint ringlets flanking its core, and a single
ringlet can be seen in the Encke Gap, crossing through center.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 18 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible blue light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 4, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.7
million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 161 degrees. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
