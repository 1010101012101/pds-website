**Caption:**

With the Sun directly behind Cassini, the spacecraft spies the opposition
surge in Saturn's inner A ring. The opposition effect becomes visible from
this special viewing geometry. See [PIA08247](PIA08247.html) for a detailed description
of the effect.

This view looks toward the rings from about 11 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Dec. 2, 2006 at a distance of approximately 287,000
kilometers (178,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 17 kilometers
(11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
