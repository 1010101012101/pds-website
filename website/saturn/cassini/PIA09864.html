Titan emerges from behind Saturn, while Tethys streaks into view, in this
colorful scene. Saturn's shadow darkens the far arm of the rings near the
planet's limb.

Titan is 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) wide; Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665
miles) wide.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 3
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were
acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 30, 2008 at a
distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 77 kilometers (48 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
