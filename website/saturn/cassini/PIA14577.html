A pair of Saturn's moons appears as if hung below the planet's rings in this
Cassini spacecraft view.

Enceladus (313 miles, or 504 kilometers across) appears just below the rings
here, near the center of the image. Tethys (660 miles, or 1,062 kilometers
across) is near the bottom center of the image. Tethys is closer to Cassini
than is Enceladus.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 13, 2011. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
169,000 miles (272,000 kilometers) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 135 degrees. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 129,000 miles (208,000 kilometers) from Tethys and
at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 135 degrees. Image scale is 10
miles (16 kilometers) per pixel on Enceladus and 7 miles (12 kilometers) per
pixel on Tethys.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
