**Original Caption Released with Image: **      Wind-blown clouds and haze high in Saturn's atmosphere are captured in a movie made from images taken by the Cassini narrow angle camera between Feb. 15 and Feb. 19, 2004. 

The bright areas in these images represent high haze and clouds near the top
of Saturn's troposphere. Cassini has three filters designed to sense different
heights of clouds and haze in the planet's atmosphere. Any light detected by
cameras using the 889-nanometer filter is reflected very high in the
atmosphere, before the light is absorbed.

This is the first movie ever made showing Saturn in these near-infrared
wavelengths. The images were made using a filter sensitive to a narrow range
of wavelengths centered at 889-nanometers, where methane in Saturn's
atmosphere absorbs sunlight.

In the movie, atmospheric motions can be seen most clearly in the equatorial
region and at other southern latitudes. Saturn's equatorial region seems
disturbed in the same way that it has been for the past decade, as revealed by
observations from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope. Researchers have speculated
that the bright cloud patterns there are associated with water-moist
convection arising from a deeper atmospheric level where water condenses on
Saturn, and rising to levels at or above the visible cloud tops. Close
analysis of future data by scientists on the Cassini-Huygens mission should
help determine whether this is the case.

Saturn's rings are extremely overexposed in these images. Because the range of
wavelengths for this spectral filter is narrow, and because most of this light
is absorbed by Saturn, the disc of Saturn is inherently faint and the
exposures required are quite long (22 seconds). The rings do not strongly
absorb at these wavelengths, so they reflect more light and are overexposed
compared to the atmosphere. Orbiting moons in the images were manually removed
during processing. The movie, consisting of 30 stacked images, spans five days
and captures five complete but non-consecutive Saturn rotations. The direction
of motion is from left to right. Each 10.6-hour Saturn rotation is evenly
sampled by six images. After each rotation sequence, the planet can be seen to
grow slightly in the field of view. Cassini was 65.6 million kilometers (40.7
million miles) from Saturn when the images, reduced in scale by a factor of
two onboard the spacecraft, were taken. The resulting image scale is
approximately 786 kilometers (420 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colorado.
