Researchers modeled eruptions on Saturn's moon Enceladus as uniform curtains
along prominent fractures that stretch across the icy moon's south pole. They
found that brightness enhancements appear as optical illusions in places where
the viewer is looking through a "fold" in the curtain. The folds exist because
the fractures in Enceladus' surface are more wavy than perfectly straight. The
researchers think this optical illusion is responsible for most -- but not all
-- of what appear to be individual jets. Some discrete jets are still required
to explain Cassini's observations.

Phantom jets in simulated images produced by the scientists line up nicely
with some of the features in real Cassini images that appear to be discrete
columns of spray. The correspondence between simulation and spacecraft data
suggests that much of the discrete-jet structure is an illusion.

Curtain eruptions occur on Earth where molten rock, or magma, gushes out of a
deep fracture. These eruptions, which often create spectacular curtains of
fire, are seen in places like Hawaii, Iceland and the Galapagos Islands.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
