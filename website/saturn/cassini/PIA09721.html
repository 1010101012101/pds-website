**Caption:**

Dione looms large before the rings of Saturn.

Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) can be spotted to the lower left 
of the larger moon, peeking out from behind the rings.

This view looks toward the leading hemisphere of Dione (1,126 kilometers, 
or 700 miles across). North is up and rotated 25 degrees to the right. The 
view is toward the sunlit side of the rings from less than a degree below 
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on July 22, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 695,000 kilometers (432,000 miles) from Dione. Image 
scale is 4 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
