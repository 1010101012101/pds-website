**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft continues to observe brightness variations along 
the orbital direction within Saturn's B ring.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 53 degrees 
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Dec. 17, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.3 
million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 8 
kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
