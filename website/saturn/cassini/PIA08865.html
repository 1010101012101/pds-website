The Cassini spacecraft continues to observe brightness variations along the
orbital direction within Saturn's B ring.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 53 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Dec. 17, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.3 million
kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
