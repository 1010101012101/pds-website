The Cassini spacecraft views Saturn's southern latitudes in color, spying a
great, eye-shaped vortex just northward of the south polar region. Other dark
vortices, common features of Saturn's general circulation, are visible in the
mid-latitudes.

Contrast in the image was enhanced to make features in the atmosphere more
visible.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this near-natural color view. The images were taken in visible light
with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 14, 2007 at a distance
of approximately 958,000 kilometers (595,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 54 kilometers (33 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
