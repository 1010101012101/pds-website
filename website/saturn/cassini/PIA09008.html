**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft's views from edge-on with the rings are perfect for capturing
multiple Saturnian moons grouped closely.

Here Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across), with its enormous crater
Odysseus, is partly overexposed near upper right. At left, Epimetheus (116 kilometers,
or 72 miles across) hovers above the rings, while Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles
across) hangs below.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera
on July 2, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles)
from Saturn. Image scale is 12 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel on Tethys, 13 kilometers
(8 miles) per pixel on Pandora, and 14 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on Epimetheus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations
center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
