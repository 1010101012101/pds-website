Saturn's northern storm marches through the planet's atmosphere in the top
right of this false-color mosaic from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

See [PIA14905](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14905) to learn
more about this storm and watch its development over several months. Earlier
in the Cassini mission, the spacecraft chronicled a smaller storm in the
southern hemisphere, called the "Dragon Storm." See
[PIA06197](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06197) to learn more
about that storm and to see a similar, false-color view.

Saturn's atmosphere and its rings are shown here in a false-color composite
made from 12 images taken in near-infrared light through filters that are
sensitive to varying degrees of methane absorption. Red and orange colors in
this view indicate clouds that are deep in the atmosphere. Yellow and green
colors, most noticeable along the top edge of the view, indicate intermediate
clouds. White and blue indicate high clouds and haze. The rings appear as a
thin horizontal line of bright blue because they are outside of the atmosphere
and not affected by methane absorption.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ring plane.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a
combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light. The images filtered at 890 nanometers are projected as blue. The images
filtered at 728 nanometers are projected as green, and images filtered at 752
nanometers are projected as red.

The images were taken on Jan. 11, 2011, over about 50 minutes, at a distance
of approximately 569,000 miles (915,000 kilometers) from Saturn and at a sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 45 degrees. The images were re-projected
to the same viewing geometry, so that scale in this final mosaic is 63 miles
(102 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
