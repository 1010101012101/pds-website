Huge clouds swirl through the southern latitudes of Saturn where the rings
cast dramatic shadows.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 30,
2010 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 728 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 67 degrees. Image scale is 79 kilometers
(49 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
