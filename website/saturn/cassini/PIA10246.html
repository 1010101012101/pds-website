This is an artist concept of the ring of debris that may orbit Saturn's
second-largest moon, Rhea. The suggested disk of solid material is exaggerated
in density here for clarity.

Due to a decrease in the number of electrons detected by NASA's Cassini
spacecraft on either side of the moon, scientists suggest that rings are the
likeliest cause of these electrons being blocked before they reach Cassini.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The magnetospheric
imaging instrument was designed, built and is operated by an international
team led by the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University,
Laurel, Md.
