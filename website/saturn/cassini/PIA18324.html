Saturn's moon Prometheus, seen here looking suspiciously blade-like, is
captured near some of its sculpting in the F ring.

Prometheus' (53 miles or 86 kilometers across) orbit sometimes takes it into
the F ring. When it enters the ring, it leaves a gore where its gravitational
influence clears out some of the smaller ring particles. Below Prometheus, the
dark lanes interior to the F ring's bright core provide examples of previous
ring-moon interactions.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 7
degrees below the ring plane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 15, 2015.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 286,000 miles (461,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 115
degrees. Image scale is 1.7 miles (2.8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
