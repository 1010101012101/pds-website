The opposition effect, a brightness surge that is visible on Saturn's rings
when the sun is directly behind the spacecraft, is captured here as a colorful
halo of light moving across Saturn's sunlit rings.

The rainbow of color seen here is actually an artifact and a by-product of the
spot's movement and the way the color image was produced. Cassini acquires
color images by taking sequential exposures using red, green and blue spectral
filters, which are then composited together to form a color view. The bright
patch traveled across the rings between exposures taken for this view,
creating a series of three colorful spots showing its position at three
separate moments.

See [PIA08247](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08247) for more
information about the opposition effect.
[PIA08267](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08267) shows a movie
sequence of the bright spot traveling across the rings.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 9 degrees below
the ringplane.

The images in this view were acquired with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on June 12, 2007, at a distance of approximately 523,000 kilometers
(325,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 31 kilometers (19 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
