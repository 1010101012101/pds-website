Dazzling Titan glows with a 360-degree sunset as light scatters through its
very extended atmosphere. Some structure is visible in the hazes of the
northern polar hood.

To the left is Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across), far off on the
opposite side of the ringplane. The rings show their unlit side to Cassini, as
the spacecraft viewed them from slightly above the ringplane.

A world with strikingly Earth-like physical processes, frigid Titan is
Saturn's largest natural satellite, at 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) across.
Titan's image is saturated at the 5 o'clock position.

The view was acquired in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on June 2, 2006 at a distance of approximately 2.3 million
kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Titan and at a Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 163 degrees. Cassini was 3.7 million kilometers (2.3 million
miles) from Janus. Image scale is 14 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on Titan
and 22 kilometers (14 miles) on Janus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
