Sometimes at Saturn you can see things almost as if from every angle at once,
the way a Cubist might imagine things. For example, in this image, we're
seeing Saturn's A ring in the lower part of the image and the limb of Saturn
in the upper. In addition, the rings cast their shadows onto the portion of
the planet imaged here, creating alternating patterns of light and dark. This
pattern is visible even through the A ring, which, unlike the core of the
nearby B ring, is not completely opaque.

The ring shadows on Saturn often appear to cross the surface at confusing
angles in close-ups like this one. The visual combination of Saturn's
oblateness, the varying opacity of its rings and the shadows cast by those
rings, sometimes creates elaborate and complicated patterns from Cassini's
perspective.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 19 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 5, 2014.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.2 million miles (2
million kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 7 miles (11 kilometers) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
