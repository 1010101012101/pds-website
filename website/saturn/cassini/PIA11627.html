Janus, Saturn's small moon named after the two-faced god, here displays two
illuminated hemispheres.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) orbits beyond the thin F ring in
the top left of the image. The moon is lit by sunlight on the left and light
reflected off Saturn on the right.

This image, taken a little more than a week after Saturn's August 2009
equinox, also shows vertical structures in the F ring casting faint shadows
near the middle right of the image. The novel illumination geometry that
accompanies equinox lowers the sun's angle to the ringplane, significantly
darkens the rings, and causes out-of-plane structures to look anomalously
bright and cast shadows across the rings. These scenes are possible only
during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only
once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have
spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 10
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Aug. 20, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
