**Caption:**

This view looks up toward the sunlit side of Saturn's rings, as Dione and
Pandora trundle by. The moons are on the near side of the rings and the
planet's shadow stretches across the rings in the background.

The diameter of Dione is (700 miles across), while Pandora is 84
kilometers (52 miles) across.

The Cassini spacecraft took this image in visible light with its
narrow-angle camera on Sept. 16, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.4
million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 12
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel on Dione.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
