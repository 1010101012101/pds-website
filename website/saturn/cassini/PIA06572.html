Mimas is caught in the spotlight beneath Saturn's rings in this amazing view
from Cassini. Notable is the brightened outermost edge of the A ring beyond
the narrow Keeler gap and the periodic brightening of the thin, knotted F
ring. Mimas is 398 kilometers (247 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on Dec. 18, 2004, at a distance of 2 million kilometers (1.3 million
miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 105
degrees. The image scale is about 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) per pixel. The
image has been magnified by a factor of two and contrast enhanced to aid
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
