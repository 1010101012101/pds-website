**Caption:**

Two large impact basins, including the 450-kilometer-wide (280-mile) 
Odysseus basin (at the top), mark the face of Saturn's moon Tethys. The 
outer edge of Saturn's rings is visible at the lower right. 

Just discernable is a slight north-south difference in brightness across 
Tethys' surface. North on Tethys is up and tilted about 20 degrees to the 
left. This view shows principally the anti-Saturn hemisphere of Tethys. 
Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on April 3, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.8 
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Tethys and at a 
Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase angle of 80 degrees. The image scale is 
11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
