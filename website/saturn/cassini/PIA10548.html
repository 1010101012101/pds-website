Gray Mimas appears to hover above the colorful rings.

The large crater seen on the right side of the moon is named for William
Herschel, who discovered Mimas in 1789.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this full color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 9, 2007 at a distance of approximately
3.151 million kilometers (1.958 million miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 34 degrees. Image scale is 19 kilometers (12
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
