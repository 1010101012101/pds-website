A color portrait of Saturn's sunlight-scattering rings hosts a group of
several moons.

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is visible at top. At bottom,
in increasing distance from the rings are Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles
across), Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) and Mimas (397
kilometers, or 247 miles across).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 10
degrees above the ringplane. Saturn's shadow can be seen on the rings at upper
left.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this composite color view.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec.
22, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.8 million
kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about 110
kilometers (68 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
