**Caption:**

A color portrait of Saturn's sunlight-scattering rings hosts a group of 
several moons.

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is visible at top. At 
bottom, in increasing distance from the rings are Pandora (84 kilometers, 
or 52 miles across), Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) and Mimas 
(397 kilometers, or 247 miles across).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 10 
degrees above the ringplane. Saturn's shadow can be seen on the rings at 
upper left.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this composite color view. 

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on 
Dec. 22, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.8 
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about 
110 kilometers (68 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
