This graphic shows a 3-D model of 98 geysers whose source locations and tilts
were found in a Cassini imaging survey of Enceladus' south polar terrain by
the method of triangulation. While some jets are strongly tilted, it is clear
the jets on average lie in four distinct "planes" that are normal to the
surface at their source location.

Dotted vectors indicate five jets whose sources were determined from images
acquired too closely in time to determine tilts accurately. Consequently their
3-D configuration has a large uncertainty associated with it.

Two geysers, indicated by crosses in
[PIA17188](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17188), have no tilt
determinations at all and are not shown here.

A movie showing a 360-degree view of this model is also presented here.

The still graphic and the movie illustrate some of the findings reported in a
paper by Porco, DiNino, and Nimmo, and published in the online version of the
_Astronomical Journal_ in July 2014: [http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/
3/46](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45). .

Post-equinox images like this, clearly showing the different projected
locations of the intersection between the shadow and the curtain of jets from
each fracture, were useful for scientists in checking the triangulated
positions of the geysers, as described in a paper by Porco, DiNino, and Nimmo,
and published in the online version of the _Astronomical Journal_ in July
2014: <http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45>.

A companion paper, by Nimmo _et al_. is available at:
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/46>.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
