Saturn's rings throw imposing shadows and relegate parts of the planet's
northern regions to darkness. Three thin and bright arcs in this scene
represent three well-known gaps in the immense ring system. From bottom to top
here (and widest to thinnest) they are the Cassini Division, the Encke Gap and
the Keeler Gap.

The image was taken in infrared light (752 nanometers) using the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 29, 2005, at a distance of approximately
446,000 kilometers (277,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 23
kilometers (14 miles) per pixel. The image was contrast enhanced to improve
visibility of features in the atmosphere.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
