Cassini's celestial sleuthing has paid off with a series of images which
confirmed earlier suspicions that a small moon was orbiting within the narrow
Keeler gap within Saturn's rings.

This view was created by combining six individual, unmagnified frames from the
movie sequence of images in which the moon was discovered. The digital
composite view improves the overall resolution of the scene compared to that
available in any of the single images (see
[PIA06238](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06238) for the movie
sequence).

The Keeler gap is located about 250 kilometers (155 miles) inside the outer
edge of the A ring, which is also the outer edge of the bright main rings. The
new object is about 7 kilometers (4 miles) across and reflects about 50
percent of the sunlight light that falls upon it -- a brightness that is
typical of particles in the nearby rings.

The new body has been provisionally named S/2005 S1.

Imaging scientists predicted the moon's presence and its orbital distance from
Saturn after July 2004, when they saw a set of peculiar spiky and wispy
features in the Keeler gap's outer edge. The similarities of the Keeler gap
features to those noted in Saturn's F ring and the Encke gap led the
scientists to conclude that a small body, a few kilometers across, was lurking
in the center of the Keeler gap, awaiting discovery.

Also included here is a view of the same scene created by combining six
individual, unmagnified frames used in the movie sequence. This digital
composite view improves the overall resolution of the scene compared to that
available in any of the single images.

These images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
May 1, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (708,000
miles) from Saturn. Resolution in the original image was 8 kilometers (5
miles) per pixel. The images in the movie sequence have been magnified in (the
vertical direction only) by a factor of two to aid visibility of features
caused within the gap by the moonlet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
