Saturn's small moon Prometheus, slightly overexposed in this image, shows off
its potato-like shape as it orbits in the Roche Division between the A ring
and thin F ring.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) periodically creates streamer-
channels in the F ring, and a streamer-channel can be seen in the upper left.
To learn more and to watch a movie of this process, see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

More than a dozen background stars are visible. This view looks toward the
northern, unilluminated side of the rings from about 57 degrees above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 31, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (994,000 miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
