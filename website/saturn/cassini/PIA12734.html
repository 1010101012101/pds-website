Capturing the interplay between light and shadow, the Cassini spacecraft looks
toward the night side of Saturn where sunlight reflected off the rings has
dimly illuminated what would otherwise be the dark side of the planet.

Saturn's southern hemisphere occupies the lower left of the image, and Cassini
is looking up toward the rings here. The planet casts a shadow that cuts
across the rings in the top right of the image. In the top left of the image,
it seems that the rings are casting shadows on the planet. That is not the
case. The dark areas in the top left are the rings themselves, and they are
blocking Cassini's view of the light that is reflected off the rings and onto
the planet, as seen in the middle left and lower left of the image.

For a different perspective, see [this view](http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/cgi-bin
/wspace?tbody=699&vbody=-82&month=9&day=2&year=2010&hour=16&minute=00&fovmul=1
&rfov=30&bfov=50&showsc=1) from the [Solar System
Simulator](http://space.jpl.nasa.gov/).

Some sunlight from the day side of the planet scatters through the planet's
atmosphere and illuminates the limb of Saturn in the middle left of the image.
See [PIA12705](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12705) and
[PIA12603](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12603) for similar
views and to learn more.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 4 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 2, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
435,000 kilometers (270,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 178 degrees. Image scale is 22 kilometers (14 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
