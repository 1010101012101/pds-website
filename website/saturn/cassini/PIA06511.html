**Caption:**

The inner edges of Saturn's rings arc gracefully across the top of this 
image from Cassini. Thin shadows cast by the rings are visible at upper 
right through the optically thin C ring.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard 
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team 
is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
