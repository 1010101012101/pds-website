**Caption:**

Cassini spies a shadow cast by a vertically extended structure or object
in the F ring in this image taken as Saturn approaches its August 2009
equinox.

The structure can be seen as a bulge near the bright core of the ring on
the right of the image. Imaging scientists are working to understand the
origin of structures such as this one, but they think this image shows the
shadow of what appears to be a vertically extended object in the core of
the F ring.

The second (bottom) version of the image has been brightened to enhance
the visibility of the ring and shadow. Background stars appear elongated
in the image because of the camera's exposure time.

This image and others like it (see [PIA11662](PIA11662.html)) are only possible around the
time of Saturn's equinox which occurs every half-Saturn-year (equivalent
to about 15 Earth years). The illumination geometry that accompanies
equinox lowers the sun's angle to the ring plane and causes out-of-plane
structures to cast long shadows across the rings. Cassini's cameras have
spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the
rings themselves (see [PIA11654](PIA11654.html)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 54 degrees
below the ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 9, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 592,000 kilometers (368,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 97 degrees. Image scale is 3
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
