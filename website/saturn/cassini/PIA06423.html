**Caption:**

Saturn's atmosphere is prominently shown with the rings emerging from
behind the planet at upper right. The two moons on the left of the image
are Mimas and Enceladus.

This image was taken on August 8, 2004, with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow angle camera in red, green, and blue filters. This image was
taken 8.5 million kilometers (5.3 million miles) from Saturn. Contrast
has been enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
