A bright, powerful, lightning-producing storm churns and coasts along the lane
of Saturn's southern hemisphere nicknamed "Storm Alley" by scientists.

NASA's Cassini spacecraft detected this particular tempest after nearly two
years during which Saturn did not appear to produce any large electrical
storms of this kind. The storm appears as a bright, irregular splotch on the
planet near lower right.

Lightning flashes within the persistent storm produce radio waves, called
Saturn Electrostatic Discharges, which the Cassini radio and plasma wave
science instrument first detected on Nov. 27, 2007. Cassini's imaging cameras
then spotted the storm, taking the images used to create this color view about
a week later on Dec. 6.

This electrical storm is similar in appearance and intensity to those
previously monitored by Cassini. All of these powerful electrostatic producing
storms appeared at about 35 degrees south latitude on Saturn. (See
[PIA07788](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07788),
[PIA08142](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08142) and
[PIA06197](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06197) for additional
images of Saturn's electrical storms imaged by Cassini.)

This storm has now been continuously tracked by Cassini for several months,
whereas previous storms observed by the spacecraft lasted for less than 30
days: See [PIA08411](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08411) for
images of the storm acquired three months after this view. The view looks
toward the un-illuminated side of the rings from about 5 degrees above the
ringplane. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) is seen here in the
foreground, and casts its shadow onto the high northern latitudes.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of approximately 1.7 million
kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 97 kilometers (60
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo. The radio and plasma wave science team is based at the
University of Iowa, Iowa City.
