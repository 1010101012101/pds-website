**Caption:**

The shadow of Saturn's moon Mimas dips onto the planet's rings and 
straddles the Cassini Division in this natural color image taken as Saturn 
approaches its August 2009 equinox.

The novel illumination geometry created as the Saturnian system approaches 
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial 
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only 
during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only 
once in about 15 Earth years. To see a movie of Mimas' shadow moving 
across the rings, see [PIA11658](PIA11658.html). Mimas, 396 kilometers (246 miles) across, 
does not appear in this image, but the moon has a flattened, or oblate, 
shape (see [PIA07534](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07534)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 52 degrees 
below the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral 
filters were combined to create this natural color view. The images were 
obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 8, 2009 at 
a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from 
Saturn. Image scale is 64 kilometers (40 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
