The shadow of Saturn's moon Mimas dips onto the planet's rings and straddles
the Cassini Division in this natural color image taken as Saturn approaches
its August 2009 equinox.

The novel illumination geometry created as the Saturnian system approaches
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To see a movie of Mimas' shadow moving across the rings,
see [PIA11658](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11658). Mimas, 396
kilometers (246 miles) across, does not appear in this image, but the moon has
a flattened, or oblate, shape (see
[PIA07534](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07534)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 52 degrees
below the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters
were combined to create this natural color view. The images were obtained with
the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 8, 2009 at a distance of
approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 64 kilometers (40 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
