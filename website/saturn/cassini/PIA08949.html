**Caption:**

Storms and cloud bands emerge from beneath Saturn's obscuring hazes in 
this infrared view.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 20 degrees 
below the ringplane. The inner rings partly obscure the planet at top.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on 
July 12, 2005 at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (900,000 
miles) from Saturn. The monochrome view uses a combination of images 
taken using spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of light centered at 728, 
752 and 890 nanometers. Image scale is 170 kilometers (105 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
