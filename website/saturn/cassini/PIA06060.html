**Caption:**

As Cassini coasts into the final month of its nearly seven-year trek, the serene 
majesty of its destination looms ahead. The spacecraft's cameras are 
functioning beautifully and continue to return stunning views from 
Cassini's position, 1.2 billion kilometers (750 million miles) from Earth 
and now 15.7 million kilometers (9.8 million miles) from Saturn.

In this narrow angle camera image from May 21, 2004, the ringed planet 
displays subtle, multi-hued atmospheric bands, colored by yet 
undetermined compounds. Cassini mission scientists hope to determine the 
exact composition of this material.

This image also offers a preview of the detailed survey Cassini will 
conduct on the planet's dazzling rings. Slight differences in color 
denote both differences in ring particle composition and light scattering 
properties.

Images taken through blue, green and red filters were combined to create 
this natural color view. The image scale is 132 kilometers (82 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
