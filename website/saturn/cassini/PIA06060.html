As Cassini coasts into the final month of its nearly seven-year trek, the
serene majesty of its destination looms ahead. The spacecraft's cameras are
functioning beautifully and continue to return stunning views from Cassini's
position, 1.2 billion kilometers (750 million miles) from Earth and now 15.7
million kilometers (9.8 million miles) from Saturn.

In this narrow angle camera image from May 21, 2004, the ringed planet
displays subtle, multi-hued atmospheric bands, colored by yet undetermined
compounds. Cassini mission scientists hope to determine the exact composition
of this material.

This image also offers a preview of the detailed survey Cassini will conduct
on the planet's dazzling rings. Slight differences in color denote both
differences in ring particle composition and light scattering properties.

Images taken through blue, green and red filters were combined to create this
natural color view. The image scale is 132 kilometers (82 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
