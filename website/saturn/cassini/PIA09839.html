**Caption:**

Beyond the expanse of the rings sits Saturn's innermost large moon, Mimas. 
The rim of the large crater Herschel is visible as a flattening of the 
moon's leading side, at left.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 6 
degrees above the ringplane. Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 18, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (989,000 miles) from Mimas. Image 
scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
