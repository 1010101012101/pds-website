Beyond the expanse of the rings sits Saturn's innermost large moon, Mimas. The
rim of the large crater Herschel is visible as a flattening of the moon's
leading side, at left.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 6 degrees
above the ringplane. Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 18, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (989,000 miles) from Mimas. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
