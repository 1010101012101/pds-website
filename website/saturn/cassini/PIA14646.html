Saturn's north polar hexagon basks in the Sun's light now that spring has come
to the northern hemisphere. Many smaller storms dot the north polar region and
Saturn's signature rings, which appear to disappear on account of Saturn's
shadow, put in an appearance in the background.

The north polar hexagon was first observed by Voyager. To see more of the
hexagon, see [PIA10486](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10486) and
[PIA11682](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11682).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft's wide-angle camera on Nov.
27, 2012 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 750 nanometers.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 403,000 miles (649,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 21
degrees. Image scale is 22 miles (35 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
