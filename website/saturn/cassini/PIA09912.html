**Caption:**

A sliver of "ringshine" pierces the darkness of Saturn's night side.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 58 
degrees above the ringplane.

The ring shadows fall into darkness beyond the terminator in the north. 
South of the equator, a dim glow brightens the darkened globe. This light, 
called ringshine, comes from sunlight reflected off the sunward side of 
the expansive rings (the opposite face of the ringplane from this 
perspective). The effect is pronounced in the eclipse view [PIA08329](PIA08329.html).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on April 19, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 851,000 kilometers (529,000 miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 48 kilometers (30 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
