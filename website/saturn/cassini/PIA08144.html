The Cassini spacecraft looks toward giant Saturn and its moon Tethys, while a
large and powerful storm rages in the planet's southern hemisphere. The storm
was observed by the Cassini spacecraft beginning in late Jan. 2006, and was at
the time large and bright enough to be seen using modest-sized telescopes on
Earth.

The fact that the storm stands out against the subtle banding of Saturn at
visible wavelengths suggests that the storm's cloud tops are relatively high
in the atmosphere.

Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Feb. 18, 2006, at a distance of approximately 2.8 million kilometers
(1.7 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles)
per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
