Two dark spots drift across the northern skies of Saturn. The shadows are cast
by the moons Tethys and Mimas.

Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) orbits farther from Saturn than
Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) and casts the larger of the two
shadows here.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 46
degrees above the ringplane.The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 30, 2008. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (720,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 66 kilometers (41 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
