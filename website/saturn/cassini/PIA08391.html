Cassini delivers this stunning vista showing small, battered Epimetheus and
smog-enshrouded Titan, with Saturn's A and F rings stretching across the
scene.

The color information in the colorized view is completely artificial: it is
derived from red, green and blue images taken at nearly the same time and
phase angle as the clear filter image. This color information was overlaid
onto the previously released clear filter view (see
[PIA07786](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07786)) in order to
approximate the scene as it might appear to human eyes.

The prominent dark region visible in the A ring is the Encke gap (325
kilometers, or 200 miles wide), in which the moon Pan (26 kilometers, or 16
miles across) and several narrow ringlets reside. Moon-driven features which
score the A ring can easily be seen to the left and right of the Encke gap.

A couple of bright clumps can be seen in the F ring.

Epimetheus is 116 kilometers (72 miles) across and giant Titan is 5,150
kilometers (3,200 miles) across.

The view was acquired with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April
28, 2006, at a distance of approximately 667,000 kilometers (415,000 miles)
from Epimetheus and 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Titan. The
image captures the illuminated side of the rings. The image scale is 4
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel on Epimetheus and 11 kilometers (7 miles) per
pixel on Titan.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
