**Caption:**

The oblong form of Prometheus glides by, trailing behind it wiggles in 
Saturn's ribbon-like F ring.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) causes a great deal of 
perturbation to the F ring, including kinks, knots and gores in the shape 
of the ring structure. By studying the moon and its interactions with the 
F ring scientists are learning a great deal about how ring structures form 
and evolve.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 27 degrees 
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 24, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.5 
million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 9 
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
