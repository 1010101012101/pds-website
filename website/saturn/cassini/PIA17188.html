On this polar stereographic map of Enceladus' south polar terrain, all 100
geysers have been plotted whose source locations have been determined in
Cassini's imaging survey of the moon's geyser basin. The uncertainty attached
to each location is given by the size of the surrounding circle.

Five sources are indicated by dashed circles. Each of these jets appeared only
in images taken very close together in time; in other words, the source
locations have been confidently determined, but their tilts are uncertain.

The two crosses -- one on Alexandria and one at the end of Baghdad -- indicate
two jets. Each was observed in one image only but each was intersected by the
shadow of Enceladus, as in
[PIA17184](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17184), allowing a
determination of the fracture on which they lie.

This map and the information it contains were used to compare geysering
activity with enhanced thermal emission observed by Cassini's heat-measuring
instruments and with the distribution of tidal stresses across the region.
Those comparisons yielded the clues needed to ascertain the mechanisms
underlying the geysering process.

This map was part of a paper by Porco, DiNino, and Nimmo, and published in the
online version of the _Astronomical Journal_ in July 2014:
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45>.

A companion paper, by Nimmo _et al_. is available at:
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/46>.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
