**Caption:**

From a viewing angle slightly above the ringplane Cassini spied Saturn's 
moon Atlas, which orbits Saturn between the broad A ring and the thin F 
ring. The background of Saturn's atmosphere (a uniform grey in this image) 
lies approximately 76,000 kilometers (47,000 miles) beyond the little 
moon. Atlas is 32 kilometers (20 miles) across.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 
914,000 kilometers (568,000 miles) from Atlas. Resolution in the original 
image was 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel. The image has been 
contrast-enhanced and magnified by a factor of two to aid visibility. 

When viewed from the dark (unlit) side, the rings are essentially an 
inverse of their familiar appearance (see [PIA06259](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06259)) and [PIA06548](PIA06548.html)) 
to compare the different views).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
