If your eyes could only see the color red, this is how Saturn's rings would
look.

Many Cassini color images, like this one, are taken in red light so scientists
can study the often subtle color variations of Saturn's rings. These
variations may reveal clues about the chemical composition and physical nature
of the rings. For example, the longer a surface is exposed to the harsh
environment in space, the redder it becomes. Putting together many clues
derived from such images, scientists are coming to a deeper understanding of
the rings without ever actually visiting a single ring particle.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 11 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in red light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec. 6, 2014.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 870,000 miles (1.4
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
