**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Pan casts a delicate shadow onto the planet's A ring.

Shown in the center of this image, Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across)
orbits within the Encke Gap of the A ring. Other bright specks in the
image are background stars. As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox,
the planet's moons cast shadows onto the rings. To learn more about this
special time and to see a movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings,
see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 51
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 2, 2009. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000
miles) from Pan and at a Sun-Pan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 108
degrees. Image scale is 9 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
