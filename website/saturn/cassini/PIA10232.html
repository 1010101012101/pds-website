**Caption:**

Radio signals sent by NASA's Cassini spacecraft to Earth through Saturn's 
rings revealed the presence of highly unusual regular formations of 
densely grouped ring particles. The harmonic ring structure caused the 
radio signal frequency to separate into three distinct components. The 
observed frequencies determine the regular spacing to be as small as 100 
meters (320 feet), the finest-scale ring structure observed so far. 

The regularly spaced yellow grid depicts the harmonic structure in 
Saturn's inner Ring A, and the image on the bottom right shows an actual 
observed frequency pattern (spectrogram). Color represents the observed 
signal strength. The structure acts like an enormously extended natural 
diffraction grating that separates the signal frequency into the three 
distinct components shown. The frequencies determine the regular spacing 
of the diffraction grating, 160 meters (500 feet) in this case. The image 
of Saturn was taken with Cassini's cameras and is shown here to illustrate 
the occultation. For additional information on the radio observations see 
[PIA10233](PIA10233.html). 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radio 
science team is based at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at 
the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
