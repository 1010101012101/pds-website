Radio signals sent by NASA's Cassini spacecraft to Earth through Saturn's
rings revealed the presence of highly unusual regular formations of densely
grouped ring particles. The harmonic ring structure caused the radio signal
frequency to separate into three distinct components. The observed frequencies
determine the regular spacing to be as small as 100 meters (320 feet), the
finest-scale ring structure observed so far.

The regularly spaced yellow grid depicts the harmonic structure in Saturn's
inner Ring A, and the image on the bottom right shows an actual observed
frequency pattern (spectrogram). Color represents the observed signal
strength. The structure acts like an enormously extended natural diffraction
grating that separates the signal frequency into the three distinct components
shown. The frequencies determine the regular spacing of the diffraction
grating, 160 meters (500 feet) in this case. The image of Saturn was taken
with Cassini's cameras and is shown here to illustrate the occultation. For
additional information on the radio observations see

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radio science team
is based at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science
Institute in Boulder, Colo.
