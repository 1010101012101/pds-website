As enchanting as it is scientifically intriguing, Saturn is a world of
unparalleled beauty and limitless potential for learning.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across, at right) and Enceladus (505
kilometers, or 314 miles across, at left) float across the field of view as
bright clouds roll through the gas giant's skies. The rings cast dark shadows
onto the planet's mid-northern latitudes.

This view looks toward Saturn from edge-on with the ringplane.

The image was taken using a combination of spectral filters sensitive to
wavelengths of polarized infrared light. The view was obtained with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 8, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 168 kilometers (104 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
