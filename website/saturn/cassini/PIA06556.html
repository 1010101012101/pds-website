**Caption:**

Wave-like patterns in Saturn's rings and a nearly half-full Mimas are
caught together in this image from Cassini. Mimas is 398 kilometers (247
miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow
angle camera on Nov. 19, 2004, at a distance of approximately 4.8 million
kilometers (3 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 29 kilometers
(18 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate,
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
