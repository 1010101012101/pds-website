Saturn's moon Rhea is gently lit in front of a background of the planet with a
wide shadow cast by the rings which are seen nearly edge-on.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949
miles across) and toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on May 8, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Rhea and at a
sun-Rhea-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 101 degrees. Image scale is 13
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
