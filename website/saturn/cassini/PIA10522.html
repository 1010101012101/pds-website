The Encke and Keeler gaps are visible in this image of the outer A ring.
Brightness variations are clearly visible in the Encke ringlet.

A density wave can be seen exterior to (to the left of) the Encke gap, and the
region exterior to (to the left of) the Keeler gap is considerably brighter
than the rest of the ring.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 23, 2008 at a distance of approximately 721,000 kilometers
(448,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
58 degrees. Image scale is 4 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
