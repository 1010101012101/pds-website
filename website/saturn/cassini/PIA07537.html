This sweeping view of Saturn's rings offers a look at how the planet's moons
help shape and maintain this structure, making Saturn the jewel of the solar
system.

Some of the bright lanes seen here within the main rings are due to resonances
with moons such as Mimas, Janus and Prometheus, whose gravity nudges the
orbits of the ring particles. These resonances can also cause dark gaps in the
rings, like the Cassini Division.

Clumps are visible in both the thin, outer F ring and the ringlets within the
Encke Gap; the latter is maintained by the presence of tiny Pan (20
kilometers, or 12 miles, across at left of center). The clumps result from
gravitational interactions of ring particles with the small moons that orbit
nearby. The structurally complex F ring is maintained by the presence of the
moons Prometheus and Pandora, not pictured (see
[PIA06595](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06595)).

Pan also creates dark wakes, which can faintly be seen here immediately
interior to the inner edge of the Encke Gap.

The view is from beneath Saturn's ringplane, looking upward.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 24, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles)
per pixel. Contrast was enhanced to improve the visibility of faint objects in
the scene.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
