**Caption:**

Cassini spacecraft spots a couple of large, wedge-shaped spokes in 
Saturn's B ring. 

pokes are similar in appearance to those seen by the Voyager spacecraft 
(see [PIA02275](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02275)).

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) can be spotted interior to 
the narrow F ring at left. Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across at its 
widest point) is barely visible within the Encke Gap, below center.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 26 degrees 
below the ringplane. Pan has been brightened in this image for better 
visibility. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 8, 2008. The view was acquired at a 
distance of approximately 749,000 kilometers (465,000 miles) from Saturn 
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 31 degrees. Image scale 
is 41 kilometers (26 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
