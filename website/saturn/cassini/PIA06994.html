**Caption:**

This false color image of two density waves in Saturn's A ring was made 
from the stellar occultation observed by Cassini's ultraviolet imaging 
spectrograph when the spacecraft was 6.3 million kilometers (4 million 
miles) from Saturn. 

Bright areas indicate the denser regions of the rings. The bright bands 
in the left part of the image are the "peaks" of a density wave caused by 
gravitational stirring of the rings by Saturn's moon, Janus. A smaller 
density wave in the right half of the image is produced by the moon 
Pandora. The ultraviolet imaging spectrograph observed the brightness of 
the star Xi Ceti as the rings passed in front of it, and the flickering 
of the starlight was converted into the ring density depicted by the 
image. The image represents a distance of about 724 kilometers (450 
miles), and the smallest features are about one-half mile across.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed 
and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging spectrograph was built at, 
and the team is based at the University of Colorado, Boulder.
