This false color image of two density waves in Saturn's A ring was made from
the stellar occultation observed by Cassini's ultraviolet imaging spectrograph
when the spacecraft was 6.3 million kilometers (4 million miles) from Saturn.

Bright areas indicate the denser regions of the rings. The bright bands in the
left part of the image are the "peaks" of a density wave caused by
gravitational stirring of the rings by Saturn's moon, Janus. A smaller density
wave in the right half of the image is produced by the moon Pandora. The
ultraviolet imaging spectrograph observed the brightness of the star Xi Ceti
as the rings passed in front of it, and the flickering of the starlight was
converted into the ring density depicted by the image. The image represents a
distance of about 724 kilometers (450 miles), and the smallest features are
about one-half mile across.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington,
D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The
ultraviolet imaging spectrograph was built at, and the team is based at the
University of Colorado, Boulder.
