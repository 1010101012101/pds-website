Saturn's small moons Atlas, Prometheus, and Epimetheus keep each other company
in this Cassini spacecraft image of the planet's night side. It seems fitting
that they should do so since in Greek mythology, their namesakes were
brothers.

Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) is just inside the F ring in
this image, while Epimetheus (70 miles, or 113 kilometers across) is farther
from the rings, due right of Prometheus in this image. Atlas (19 miles, or 30
kilometers across) is between the A and F rings almost right below Epimetheus
and is very faint.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 30
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Sept. 19, 2012.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.4 million miles (2.2
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 96 degrees. Image scale is 80 miles (128 kilometers) per pixel.
Epimetheus has been brightened by a factor of 1.5 and Atlas' brightness has
been enhanced by a factor of 3 relative to the rings and Prometheus to improve
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
