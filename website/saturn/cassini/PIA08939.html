**Caption:**

This strongly enhanced false color view is a departure from the familiar 
bluish north and golden south seen in natural color Cassini spacecraft 
images, but the contrast between regions north and south of the ring 
shadows is here more readily apparent.

The northern region is marked by a multitude of bright, patchy clouds. The 
region south of the ring shadows contains the bright equatorial band seen 
in many monochrome Cassini views taken at infrared wavelengths (see [PIA07590](PIA07590.html)).

Taken just minutes after [PIA08936](PIA08936.html), this view makes Saturn's rings faintly 
visible at lower left. The false color enhancement brings out additional 
detail in the planet's clouds that is not visible in the natural color 
view.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 52 
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a 
combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light 
centered at 728 (red channel), 752 (blue channel) and 890 (green channel) 
nanometers. The view was acquired on April 5, 2007 at a distance of 
approximately 1.5 million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 84 kilometers (52 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
