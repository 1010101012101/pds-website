The narrow and twisted F ring lights up this scene, which features Mimas
against the unlit side of Saturn's ringplane. The F ring contains a great deal
of fine, icy particles that are quite effective at scattering sunlight at high
phase angles.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) is seen as a mere crescent in the
center of this haunting view.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 13, 2006 at a distance of approximately 3.9 million kilometers
(2.4 million miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 156 degrees. Image scale is 23 kilometers (15 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
