**Caption:**

With giant Saturn hanging in the blackness and sheltering Cassini from the 
sun's blinding glare, the spacecraft viewed the rings as never before, 
revealing previously unknown faint rings and even glimpsing its home 
world.

This marvelous panoramic view was created by combining a total of 165 
images taken by the Cassini wide-angle camera over nearly three hours on 
Sept. 15, 2006. The full mosaic consists of three rows of nine wide-angle 
camera footprints; only a portion of the full mosaic is shown here. Color 
in the view was created by digitally compositing ultraviolet, infrared and 
clear filter images and was then adjusted to resemble natural color.

The mosaic images were acquired as the spacecraft drifted in the darkness 
of Saturn's shadow for about 12 hours, allowing a multitude of unique 
observations of the microscopic particles that compose Saturn's faint 
rings.

Ring structures containing these tiny particles brighten substantially at 
high phase angles: i.e., viewing angles where the sun is almost directly 
behind the objects being imaged.

During this period of observation Cassini detected two new faint rings: 
one coincident with the shared orbit of the moons Janus and Epimetheus, 
and another coincident with Pallene's orbit. (See [PIA08322](PIA08322.html) and 
[PIA08328](PIA08328.html) for more on the two new rings.)

The narrowly confined G ring is easily seen here, outside the bright main 
rings. Encircling the entire system is the much more extended E ring. The 
icy plumes of Enceladus, whose eruptions supply the E ring particles, 
betray the moon's position in the E ring's left-side edge.

Interior to the G ring and above the brighter main rings is the pale dot 
of Earth. Cassini views its point of origin from over a billion kilometers 
(and close to a billion miles) away in the icy depths of the outer solar 
system. See [PIA08324](PIA08324.html) for a similar view of Earth taken during this observation.

Small grains are pushed about by sunlight and electromagnetic forces. 
Hence, their distribution tells much about the local space environment. 

A [second version](//photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/tiff/PIA08329_full_res.tif) of the mosaic view is presented here in which the 
color contrast is greatly exaggerated. In such views, imaging scientists 
have noticed color variations across the diffuse rings that imply active 
processes sort the particles in the ring according to their sizes.

Looking at the E ring in this color-exaggerated view, the distribution of 
color across and along the ring appears to be different between the right 
side and the left. Scientists are not sure yet how to explain these 
differences, though the difference in phase angle between right and left 
may be part of the explanation. The phase angle is about 179 degrees on 
Saturn.

The main rings are overexposed in a few places.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 15 degrees 
above the ringplane.

Cassini was approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from 
Saturn when the images in this mosaic were taken. Image scale on Saturn is 
about 260 kilometers (162 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
