**Caption:**

Saturn's most prominent feature, its dazzling ring system, takes center 
stage in this stunning natural color mosaic which reveals the color and 
diversity present in this wonder of the solar system. Gaps, gravitational 
resonances and wave patterns are all present, and the delicate color 
variations across the system are clearly visible.

This mosaic of six images covers a distance of approximately 62,000 
kilometers along the ring plane, from a radius of 74,565 kilometers to 
136,780 kilometers (46,333 to 84,991 miles) from the planet's center.

This view is from Cassini's vantage point beneath the ring plane. The 
rings are tilted away from Cassini at an angle of about 4 degrees.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were used to 
create this natural color mosaic. The images were acquired using the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on Dec. 12, 2004, at a distance of 
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles). The image scale 
is 10.5 kilometers (6.5 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, 
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were 
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at 
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
