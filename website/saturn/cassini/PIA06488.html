In its own way, the shepherd moon Prometheus (102 kilometers, 63 miles across)
is one of the lords of Saturn's rings. The little moon maintains the inner
edge of Saturn's thin, knotted F ring, while its slightly smaller cohort
Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across) guards the ring's outer edge.

This view is a composite of nine raw images combined in a way that improves
resolution and reduces noise. The final image was magnified by a factor of
five. One of the component images was previously released (see
[PIA06098](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06098)).

The image clearly shows that Prometheus is not round, but instead has an
oblong, potato-like shape. The moon was discovered during the Voyager mission,
and scientists then noted ridges, valleys and craters on its surface. Hints of
its varied topography are present in this view, although Cassini will likely
obtain much better images of Prometheus later in the mission.

The component images were taken over about ten and a half minutes. During that
time, the spacecraft's motion caused some blurring of the F ring in the
background. Cassini was below the ring plane at the time the images were
obtained, and the view here is across the rings toward the distant arm of the
F ring. Sunlight is coming from below left.

These images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera on
July 1, 2004, around the time Cassini entered Saturn's orbit. The spacecraft's
distance from the planet ranged from approximately 181,000 to 190,000
kilometers (112,000 to 118,000 miles) during the time the exposures were
taken. The image scale is approximately 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
