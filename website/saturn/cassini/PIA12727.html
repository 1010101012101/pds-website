Several structures in Saturn's A ring are exposed near the Encke Gap in this
Cassini image.

Structure is clearly visible in the ringlets that occupy the Encke Gap in the
lower right of this image. A peculiar kink can be seen in one particularly
bright ringlet at the bottom right. To view vertical structures in these
kinky, discontinuous ringlets casting shadows during Saturn's August 2009
equinox, see [PIA11676](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11676).

Nearly uniform striations in the A ring created by the gravitational effects
of the moon Pan dominate the left of this image. Saturn is out of the frame to
the right. Also visible are two waves -- darker banded stuctures -- to the
left of the Encke gap. See
[PIA10501](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10501) to learn more
about the waves present here.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 18 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 3, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
177,000 kilometers (110,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 60 degrees. Image scale is 700 meters (2,296 feet) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
