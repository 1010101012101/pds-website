The majesty of Saturn overwhelms in this image from Cassini. Saturn's moon
Tethys glides past in its orbit, and the icy rings mask the frigid northern
latitudes with their shadows. Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on June 10, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.4 million
kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 80 kilometers (50
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
