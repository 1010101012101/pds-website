**Caption:**

The majesty of Saturn overwhelms in this image from Cassini. Saturn's moon
Tethys glides past in its orbit, and the icy rings mask the frigid
northern latitudes with their shadows. Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665
miles) across.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on June 10, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.4
million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 80
kilometers (50 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
