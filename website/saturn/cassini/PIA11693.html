**Caption:**

A gaggle of moons parades around Saturn's rings in this movie from NASA's 
Cassini spacecraft, featuring Rhea and three other moons.

This sight may at first appear confusing, with four moons moving to and 
fro in their orbits. But imaging sequences like this, in which one moon 
passes close to or in front of another, actually help scientists refine 
their understanding of the orbits of Saturn's moons. The movie is a 
concatenation of 12 still images obtained over a span of 19 minutes. The 
images were re-projected to a uniform view and computer interpolation was 
used to smooth the moons' motion between the frames.

At the start of the movie, Rhea (1,528 kilometers, 949 miles across) is at 
the lower left and moving to the right, as seen by Cassini. Janus (179 
kilometers, 111 miles across) is near Rhea in the lower left. Mimas (396 
kilometers, 246 miles across) is near the center top and is moving left. 
About one-third of the way through the movie, Pandora (81 kilometers, 50 
miles across) enters the frame on the right, orbiting just beyond Saturn's 
rings. 

Mimas is farthest from Cassini at a distance of approximately 2.5 million 
kilometers (1.6 million miles). Rhea is closest to the spacecraft at a 
distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers (1.2 million miles). 
Mimas travels at an average speed of 14 kilometers per second (31,000 
mph). Janus' and Pandora's average speeds are each about 16 kilometers per 
second (36,000 mph). Rhea is the slowest of this quartet, traveling at an 
average speed of about 8 kilometers per second (18,000 mph).

(For other movies like this one, see [PIA11695](PIA11695.html) and [PIA11692](PIA11692.html).) 

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just 
above the ring plane.

The images were obtained in visible light with Cassini's narrow-angle 
camera on Nov. 8, 2009. The view was acquired at a Sun-Rhea-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 105 degrees. Scale on Rhea is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
