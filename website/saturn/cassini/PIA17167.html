The Cassini spacecraft captures a glimpse of the moon Atlas shortly after
emerging from Saturn's shadow. Although the sunlight at Saturn's distance is
feeble compared to that at the Earth, objects cut off from the Sun within
Saturn's shadow cool off considerably.

Scientists study how the moons around Saturn cool and warm as they enter and
leave Saturn's shadow to better understand the physical properties of Saturn's
moons.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 44 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 23, 2014.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.6 million miles (2.6
million kilometers) from Atlas and at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 93 degrees. Image scale is 10 miles (16 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
