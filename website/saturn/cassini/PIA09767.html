**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft returns another dazzling postcard from its journey
with this view of cloud-streaked Saturn and two of its moons.

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) appears against the
planet. Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) is seen below the
rings at left.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 6 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Sept. 25, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 67 degrees. Image scale
is 130 kilometers (81 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
