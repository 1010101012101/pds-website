**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Atlas plies the Roche Division between the A ring and the 
thin F ring.

Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across) is near the center of the image. 
Bright specks in the image are background stars.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 61 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 30, 2009. The view was 
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (870,000 
miles) from Atlas and at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 74 
degrees. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
