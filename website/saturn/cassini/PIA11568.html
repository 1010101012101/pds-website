The shadow of the moon Janus crosses the Encke Gap as it strikes the plane of
Saturn's rings in this image taken as the planet approached its August 2009
equinox.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) is not shown here, but the moon's
shadow appears on the A ring. Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across)
can be seen near the bottom of the image as it orbits in the Roche Division
between the A ring and the thin F ring.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies
of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 41 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on June 9, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 575,000 kilometers (357,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 76 degrees. Image scale is 31 kilometers
(19 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
