Saturn's rings lie between a pair of moons in this Cassini spacecraft view
that features Mimas and Prometheus.

Mimas (246 miles or 396 kilometers across) is the more noticeable of the two
moons and is in the top left of the view. The smaller moon Prometheus (53
miles, or 86 kilometers across) is near the center of the image and is closest
to Cassini. Mimas is beyond the rings and farthest from the spacecraft.

Lit terrain seen on Mimas is on the leading hemisphere of the moon. This view
looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 4, 2011. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
746,000 miles (1.2 million kilometers) from Prometheus and 870,000 miles (1.4
million kilometers) from Mimas. Image scale is 4 miles (7 kilometers) per
pixel on Prometheus and 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel on Mimas.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
