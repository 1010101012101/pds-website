Saturn's rings, partially darkened by the planet's shadow, cut a striking
figure before Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

The night side of the planet is to the left, out of the frame of the image.
Illuminated Titan can be seen above, below and through gaps in the rings. The
moon Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles across) is near the bottom of the
image. Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across) can barely be detected near
the thin F ring just to the right of center on the upper part of the ring.

Lit terrain seen here is the area between the leading hemisphere and Saturn-
facing side of Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across). This view
looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on March 26, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 3.5 million kilometers (2.2 million miles) from Titan and 2.1
million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Mimas. Image scale is 21
kilometers (13 miles) per pixel on Titan and 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel
on Mimas.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
