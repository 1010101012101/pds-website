**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks across Saturn's cloud-dotted north and 
shadowed pole, and out across the lanes of ice that compose its rings.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is visible between the A 
and F rings near the center of the image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 42 
degrees above the ringplane. The planet's shadow stretches toward the 
lower right corner.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on April 1, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2 
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 119 
kilometers (74 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
