**Caption:**

Saturn's C ring emerges from behind the planet's hazy limb.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 15 degrees 
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on June 17, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 937,000 kilometers (582,000 miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
