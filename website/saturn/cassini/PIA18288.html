Saturn is circled by its rings (seen nearly edge-on in this image), as well as
by the moons Tethys (the large bright body near the lower right hand corner of
this image) and Mimas (seen as a slight crescent against Saturn's disk above
the rings, at about 4 o'clock). The shadows of the rings, each ringlet
delicately recorded across Saturn's face, also circle around Saturn's south
pole.

Although the rings and larger moons of Saturn mostly orbit very near the
planet's equatorial plane, this image shows that they do not all lie precisely
in the orbital plane. Part of the reason that Mimas (246 miles, or 396
kilometers across) and Tethys (660 miles, or 1062 kilometers across) appear
above and below the ring plane because their orbits are slightly inclined
(about 1 to 1.5 degrees) relative to the rings.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from slightly above the
ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Aug. 14, 2014.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.1 million miles (1.7
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 23 degrees. Image scale is 63 miles (102 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
