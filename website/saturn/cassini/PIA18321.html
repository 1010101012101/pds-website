Although the D ring of Saturn is so thin that it's barely noticeable compared
to the rest of the ring system, it still displays structures seen in other
Saturnian rings. Here the spiral structures in the D ring are on display.

The D ring spirals, discovered in Cassini images, are believed to be due to a
warp in the ring created in the early 1980s. The precise mechanism remains the
subject of scientific debate. Over the course of the Cassini mission,
scientists have been able to observe the spiral winding ever more tightly as
it evolves. For more about the spiral, see
[PIA12820](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12820) and
[PIA08325](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08325).

(The bright specks and faint vertical streaks are merely image artifacts. The
processes typically employed to remove these artifacts would also have
degraded the exquisite details of the D ring which are visible here.)

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 22 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 6, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 350,000 miles (563,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 131
degrees. Image scale is 2.1 miles (3.4 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini mission is a cooperative project of NASA, ESA (the European Space
Agency) and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
