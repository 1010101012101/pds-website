Appearing like a freckle on the face of Saturn, a shadow from the moon
Enceladus blemishes the planet just below the ringplane in this Cassini
spacecraft image.

Enceladus is not shown here. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side
of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 10,
2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 537,000 kilometers (334,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 42 degrees. Scale in the original image
was 57 kilometers (35 miles) per pixel. The image was contrast enhanced and
magnified by a factor of 1.5 to enhance the visibility of surface features.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
