**Caption:**

Appearing like a freckle on the face of Saturn, a shadow from the moon Enceladus blemishes the planet just below the ringplane in this Cassini spacecraft image.

Enceladus is not shown here. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 10, 2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 537,000 kilometers (334,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 42 degrees. Scale in the original image was 57 kilometers (35 miles) per pixel. The image was contrast enhanced and magnified by a factor of 1.5 to enhance the visibility of surface features.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
