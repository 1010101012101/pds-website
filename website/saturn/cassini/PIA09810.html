**Caption:**

A small moon appears from behind giant Saturn, accompanied by a warped
view of the rings.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is seen here between the A
and F rings. Close to the planet, the image of the rings is slightly
distorted by Saturn's upper atmosphere.

This view is similar to [PIA09807](PIA09807.html), which features Pandora.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 9
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible red light with
the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Nov. 30, 2007. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million
miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
