A small moon appears from behind giant Saturn, accompanied by a warped view of
the rings.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is seen here between the A and
F rings. Close to the planet, the image of the rings is slightly distorted by
Saturn's upper atmosphere.

This view is similar to
[PIA09807](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09807), which features
Pandora.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 9
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible red light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Nov. 30, 2007. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from
Prometheus. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
