A scalloped look is created in the edges of the Keeler Gap in Saturn's outer A
ring as the moon Daphnis orbits in the gap.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is the bright spot in the narrow gap
near the center of the image. The small moon's gravity is great enough, and
the Keeler gap in which it resides is narrow enough, to perturb the particles
in the ring and create the wavelike patterns seen here. See
[PIA09850](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09850) to learn more
about this process. As the planet approaches its mid-August 2009 equinox,
Cassini has imaged these vertical structures casting long shadows across the
rings (see [PIA11654](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11654)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 58 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 9, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 847,000 kilometers (526,000 miles) from Daphnis and
at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 89 degrees. Image scale is 5
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
