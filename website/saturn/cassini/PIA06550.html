**Caption:**

Mimas orbits beyond the outer fringes of Saturn's main rings, perturbing 
the orbits of ring particles and creating gaps like the Huygens Gap 
within the Cassini Division (the wide, dark gap near lower left). The 
outer edge of the B ring (lower left corner) and the thin, outermost 
section of the A ring appear notably brighter than the bulk of the A 
ring, suggesting differences in ring particle density or composition. 
Small knots in the thin F ring are visible at lower right. Mimas is 398 
kilometers (247 miles) across.

This view is from Cassini's vantage point beneath the ring plane. The 
image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow 
angle camera on Nov. 18, 2004, at a distance of approximately 4.7 million 
kilometers (2.9 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 27 
kilometers (17 miles) per pixel. Contrast was enhanced to aid visibility. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, 
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were 
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at 
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
