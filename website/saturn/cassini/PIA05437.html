This Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera view shows a half-lit Saturn, with
two dark storms rolling through its southern hemisphere. The image was taken
in visible red light on July 19, 2004, at a distance of 6.2 million kilometers
(3.9 million miles) from Saturn.

The image scale is 366 kilometers (227miles) per pixel. Contrast was slightly
enhanced to bring out features in the atmosphere.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
