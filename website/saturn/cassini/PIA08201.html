The dark side of the ringplane glows with scattered light, including the
luminous F ring, which shines like a rope of brilliant neon. Below, Dione
(1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across) presents an exquisitely thin crescent.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 930 nanometers. The image was acquired with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 3, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Dione and at a
Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 160 degrees. Image scale is 11
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
