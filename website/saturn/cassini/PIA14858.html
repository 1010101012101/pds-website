NASA's Cassini spacecraft successfully completed its Oct. 1 flyby of Saturn's
moon Enceladus and its jets of water vapor and ice. At its closest approach,
the spacecraft flew approximately 62 miles (100 kilometers) above the moon's
surface. The close approach was designed to give some of Cassini's
instruments, including the ion and neutral mass spectrometer, the chance to
"taste" the jets themselves.

At a higher vantage point during the encounter, Cassini's high-resolution
camera captured pictures of the jets emanating from the moon's south polar
region. The latest raw images of Enceladus are online at:
<http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/photos/raw/>.

The images of the surface include previously seen leading-hemisphere terrain.
However, during this encounter, multi-spectral imaging of these terrains
extended farther into the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum
than had previously been achieved at this resolution. By looking at the
surface at ultraviolet wavelengths, scientists can better detect the
difference between surface materials and shadows than they can at visible
wavelengths, where icy materials are highly reflective and shadows are washed
out. With both ultraviolet and visible images of the same terrain available to
them, scientists will better understand how the surface coverage of icy
particles coming from the vents and plumes changes with terrain type and age.

Cassini's next pass of this fascinating moon will be Oct. 19, when the
spacecraft flies by at an altitude of approximately 765 miles (1231
kilometers).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo. The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer science team is based at
the Southwest Research Institute, San Antonio, Texas.
