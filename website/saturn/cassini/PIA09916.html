**Caption:**

The flattened, potato-like form of Prometheus glides silently within the
Roche Division, between Saturn's A and F rings.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across at its widest point) is on
the side of the rings closest to the Cassini spacecraft in this view. The
image looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about a degree below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on May 2, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.1 million kilometers (660,000 miles) from Prometheus.
Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
