The flattened, potato-like form of Prometheus glides silently within the Roche
Division, between Saturn's A and F rings.

Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across at its widest point) is on the
side of the rings closest to the Cassini spacecraft in this view. The image
looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about a degree below the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 2, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.1 million kilometers (660,000 miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 6
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
