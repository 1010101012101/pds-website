**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft captures a gathering of three moons near the rings'
outer edge as the icy worlds dutifully march about Saturn.

Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) hangs in front of Rhea
(1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) near left. Pandora (84 kilometers,
or 52 miles across) skirts the outer edge of the F ring below center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than
a degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 2, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 3.7 million kilometers (2.3 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is about 22 kilometers (14 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
