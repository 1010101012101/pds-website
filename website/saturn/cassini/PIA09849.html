**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft spots the irregularly shaped icy moon Janus as it
swings around Saturn.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane. Janus is 181 kilometers (113 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 19, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (994,000 miles) from Janus and at
a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 18 degrees. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
