**Caption:**

With pastel blues, pinks, greens and golds, Saturn displays a dazzling
diversity of colors and hues.

Here, Cassini looks upward at, and through, the sunlit side of the rings
from about 19 degrees below the ring plane. The small moon Janus (181
kilometers, or 113 miles across) can be spotted off the planet's western
limb (edge) near the image bottom.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural-color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 3, 2007, at a distance of
approximately 1.1 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 60 kilometers (38 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
