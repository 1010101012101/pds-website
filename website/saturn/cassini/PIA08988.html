**Caption:**

This bright, isolated plateau in the middle of the C ring displays
interesting internal variations in brightness. The plateau is not high in
terms of elevation, but rather in terms of its particle density (seen here
as brightness), which is several times higher than the surrounding ring
structure.

Ring scientists are working to understand what produces the sharp
boundaries of the plateau features, as well as the nature of the internal
variations in brightness.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 18 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 12, 2007 at a distance of approximately
230,000 kilometers (143,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 1 kilometer
(3,353 feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
