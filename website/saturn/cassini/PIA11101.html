**Caption:**

Cassini images reveal the existence of a faint arc of material orbiting
with Saturn's small moon Anthe.

The moon is moving downward and to the right in this perspective. In this
image, most of the visible material in the arc lies ahead of Anthe (2
kilometers, or 1 mile across) in its orbit. However, over time the moon
drifts slowly back and forth with respect to the arc. The arc extends over
about 20 degrees in longitude (about 5.5 percent of Anthe's orbit) and
appears to be associated with a gravitational resonance caused by the moon
Mimas. Micrometeoroid impacts on Anthe are the likely source of the arc
material. The orbit of Anthe lies between the larger moons Mimas and
Enceladus. Anthe shares this region with two other small moons, Pallene (4
kilometers, or 3 miles across) and Methone (3 kilometers, or 2 miles
across). Methone also possesses an arc (see [PIA11102](PIA11102.html)), while Pallene is known
to orbit within a faint, complete ring of its own (see [PIA08328](PIA08328.html)).

Cassini imaging scientists believe the process that maintains the Anthe
and Methone arcs is similar to that which maintains the arc in the G ring
(see [PIA08327](PIA08327.html)). The general brightness of the image (along with the faint
horizontal banding pattern) results from the long exposure time of 32
seconds required to capture the extremely faint ring arc and the
processing needed to enhance its visibility (which also enhances the
digital background noise in the image). The image was digitally processed
to remove most of the background noise. The long exposure also produced
star trails in the background. This view looks toward the un-illuminated
side of the rings from about 3 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on July 3, 2008. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (739,000 miles) from Anthe and at
a sun-Anthe-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 12 degrees. Image scale is 7
kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
