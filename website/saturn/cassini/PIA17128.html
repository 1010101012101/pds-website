A beautiful "mini-jet" appears in the dynamic F ring of Saturn. Saturn's A
ring (including the Keeler gap and just a hint of the Encke gap at the upper-
right) also appears.

The mini-jets are thought by imaging scientists to be caused by low-speed
collisions in the F ring ejecting dusty material from the ring's core. For
more on the mini-jets, see
[PIA15504](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA15504).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 48
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 20, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 841,000 miles (1.4
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 82 degrees. Image scale is 5 miles (8 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
