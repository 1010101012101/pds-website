The image on the left was taken on Nov. 1, 1980, by NASA's Voyager spacecraft
from a distance of 5.3 million kilometers (3.3 million miles). It shows a very
strong narrow shadow cast on the equatorial region of Saturn's atmosphere by
the rings. During the Voyager encounters, the Sun was close to the plane of
the rings so that the ring shadow was very deep and localized to low
latitudes.

Radio signals detected by Voyager were interpreted as lightning coming from a
persistent, extended storm system at low latitudes. It is possible that the
ring shadow was partly responsible for generating this storm by promoting
strong convection at the boundary of the colder shadowed atmosphere and the
adjoining sunlit atmosphere. This image was previously released on June 19,
1999. For original caption see

The image on the right was acquired by the Cassini spacecraft on May 10, 2004,
from a distance of 27.2 million kilometers (16.9 million miles) and shows the
complex set of ring shadows cast over a large region of Saturn's northern
hemisphere. This shadow pattern is due to the Sun being well below the ring
plane during Cassini's approach to Saturn. This image was previously release
on May 25, 2004. For original caption see
[PIA05394](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05394).

Unlike the situation when NASA's Voyager spacecraft flew by Saturn, these ring
shadows are not as deep and are not localized at a very narrow range of
latitudes. Should these shadows drive convection in Saturn's atmosphere, the
location would likely be very much different than the near-equatorial shadow
observed by the Voyagers in the early 1980s. It is possible that this very
different ring shadow geometry is one reason for different morphologies of
thunderstorms observed by Cassini and Voyager. Voyager observed lightning
apparently from one persistent, low-latitude storm system, whereas Cassini
observes lightning from storms which seem to come and go on time scales of a
day or so, and perhaps from more than one storm system at a time.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington,
D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The
radio and plasma wave science team is based at the University of Iowa, Iowa
City.
