**Caption:**

This view takes in the outer third of Saturn's C ring&mdash;from the
Maxwell Gap, at center left, to the C-ring edge at lower right.

For reference, see the labeled mosaic of the rings presented in [PIA08389](PIA08389.html).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Nov. 17, 2007. The view was obtained at
a distance of approximately 465,000 kilometers (289,000 miles) from Saturn.
Image scale at the center of this view is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel
in the radial, or outward from Saturn, direction and 42 kilometers per
pixel in the longitudinal, or around Saturn, direction.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
