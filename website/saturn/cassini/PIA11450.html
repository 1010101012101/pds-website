**Caption:**

Five wide bands near the center of this image form the structure of the 
Cassini Division&mdash;an expanse between Saturn's B and A rings that 
appears dark or black in many other images.

The 4,800-kilometer wide (2,980-mile wide) division spans the right side 
of the image along with a small part of the B ring. The inner part of the 
A ring appears on the left.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 9 degrees 
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 819,000 kilometers (509,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 154 degrees. Image scale is 5 
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
