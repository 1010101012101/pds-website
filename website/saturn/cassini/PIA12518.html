Saturn's moon Epimetheus casts a shadow across colorful rings in thisimage
taken before the planet's August 2009 equinox.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) is visible as a small dotat
the center of the bottom of the image.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun'sangle
to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causesout-of-plane
structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows acrossthe rings. These
scenes are possible only during the few months before andafter Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only thepredictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the ringsthemselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined tocreate
this natural color view. This view looks toward the southern,sunlit side of
the rings from about 39 degrees below the ringplane.

The images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera onJune
8, 2009 at a distance of approximately 725,000 kilometers (450,000miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 40 kilometers (25 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
