**Caption:**

A lone moon coasts along in this view, which was taken from less than a 
degree below Saturn's sunlit ringplane. The rings are squashed into a 
narrow band from this viewing angle, foreshortening all of their radial 
features.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) travels from left to right 
here, led by its large crater Herschel.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 26, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (661,000 miles) from Mimas. Image 
scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
