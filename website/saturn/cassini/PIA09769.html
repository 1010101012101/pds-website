Saturn's rings create a brilliant halo around the turbulent giant planet.
Here, the Cassini spacecraft looks into Saturn's clouds using a spectral
filter sensitive to absorption by methane. Light that reaches down to depths
where methane is prevalent gets absorbed. Regions of the planet devoid of the
clouds and hazes that can reflect this light back to the camera appear
relatively dark. Thus, the bright areas in these images represent hazes and
clouds high in the atmosphere.

Because the range of wavelengths for this filter is narrow, and because most
of this light is absorbed by Saturn, the planet's disk is inherently faint and
the exposures required are rather long. The rings do not strongly absorb at
these wavelengths, and so they reflect more light and are overexposed compared
to the atmosphere.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 6 degrees below
the ringplane. Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) is seen above the
rings at right.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Sept. 25,
2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 890 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 67 degrees. Image scale is 132
kilometers (82 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
