The Cassini spacecraft watches over the northern latitudes of Saturn's
geologically active moon Enceladus while the planet's rings peek through in
the distance in this snapshot.

See [PIA11684](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11684) to learn
more about the surface of the moon. This view looks toward the northern
latitudes of the anti-Saturn side of Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles
across). North on Enceladus is up and rotated 21 degrees to the left.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Dec.
21, 2010 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 752 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 34,000 kilometers (21,000 miles) from Enceladus and at a Sun-
Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 15 degrees. Image scale is 202 meters
(663 feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo..
