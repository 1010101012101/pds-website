**Caption:**

Two moons of Saturn rendezvous in the Saturnian skies above the Cassini 
spacecraft.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) is seen here just before 
gliding in front of Helene (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across), which lays 
192,000 kilometers (119,000 miles) in the distance beyond the larger moon.

The limb of Mimas is flattened in the west, where the rim if the large 
crater Herschel lies.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 3 degrees 
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 3, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.3 
million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Mimas and 1.5 million kilometers 
(1 million miles) from Helene. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per 
pixel on Mimas and 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel on Helene.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
