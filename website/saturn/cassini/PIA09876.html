**Caption:**

Saturn dominates this colorful view, taken from a vantage point high above 
the rings. From here the Cassini spacecraft can see the rings' far side, 
where the dark shadow of Saturn abruptly terminates their visibility.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across) casts its shadow onto the 
planet's northern latitudes below center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 27 
degrees above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 26, 2008 at a distance of 
approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 93 kilometers (58 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
