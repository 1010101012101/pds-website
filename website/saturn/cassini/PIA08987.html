**Caption:**

Incredible swirling details in Saturn's northern clouds can be seen in
this dazzling view. Shadows cast by the rings embrace the northern
hemisphere.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 16
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on June
10, 2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared
light centered at 939 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
