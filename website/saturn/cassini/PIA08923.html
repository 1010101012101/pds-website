**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft gazes upward at the face of giant Saturn, seeing
beyond the equator to where ring shadows fall across the bluish northern
latitudes.

This extreme southern view looks northward from about 58 degrees below the
ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 1, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 940,000 kilometers (584,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 106 kilometers (66 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
