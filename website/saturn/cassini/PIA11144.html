Dark spokes dance around Saturn's B ring in this series of movies comprised of
images taken with Cassini's wide-angle camera.

This animation is a concatenation of spoke movies acquired by NASA's Cassini
spacecraft in the second half of 2008 on Aug. 21, Sept. 19, Sept. 26, Oct. 11,
and Nov. 25.

As Saturn nears equinox in August 2009 and the sun angle on the ring plane
decreases, spokes become common sights in Cassini images, just as they were in
Voyager images (See
[PIA02275](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA02275)). The planet's
orbital period is 29.5 years, so Saturn has nearly made one complete trip
around the sun since the flybys of the two Voyager spacecraft in 1980 and
1981, allowing Cassini to closely match Voyager's viewing geometry.

Each of these five movies shows the sunlit side of the rings at low solar
phase, or spacecraft-rings-sun, angles. The spokes appear dark against
Saturn's B ring at low phase angles because the particles within them scatter
light more efficiently in the forward direction (away from Cassini) than the
surrounding larger ring particles. In the opposite viewing geometry, at high
phase angles, spokes appear bright relative to surrounding ring particles (See
[PIA07807](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07807)).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
