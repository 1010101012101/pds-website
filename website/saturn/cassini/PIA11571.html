Waves in the edges of the Keeler gap in Saturn's A ring, created by the
embedded moon Daphnis, show considerable complexity in this image taken as
Saturn approached its August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) orbits in the A ring's Keeler Gap.
Equinox has exposed shadows cast by edge waves, or vertical structures of ring
material created by Daphnis' gravity (see
[PIA11655](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11655)). The low sun
illumination angle, and the resulting shadows, have revealed a complexity in
these features not seen before.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows out-of-plane structures and moons orbiting in or near the
plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These
scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about
this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving across the rings,
see [PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 24
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 11, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
496,000 kilometers (308,000 miles) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
