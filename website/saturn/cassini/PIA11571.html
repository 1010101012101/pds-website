**Caption:**

Waves in the edges of the Keeler gap in Saturn's A ring, created by the
embedded moon Daphnis, show considerable complexity in this image taken as
Saturn approached its August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) orbits in the A ring's Keeler
Gap. Equinox has exposed shadows cast by edge waves, or vertical
structures of ring material created by Daphnis' gravity (see [PIA11655](PIA11655.html)). The
low sun illumination angle, and the resulting shadows, have revealed a
complexity in these features not seen before.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows out-of-plane structures and moons orbiting in or near
the plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after
Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn
more about this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving
across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html)
and [PIA11660](PIA11660.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 24
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on July 11, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 496,000 kilometers (308,000 miles) from Daphnis and at a
Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 3
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
