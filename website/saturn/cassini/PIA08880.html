The Cassini spacecraft captures a spectacular view of Saturn's banded southern
hemisphere and dark central polar storm, while its dazzling rings lie far
beyond the horizon.

The image was taken by the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a
combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of polarized infrared
light. The image was obtained on Jan. 31, 2007 at a distance of approximately
979,000 kilometers (608,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 110 kilometers
(68 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
