**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looked toward the darkened night side of Saturn to
capture the eerie glow of the rings, which, not being blocked by the
planet's bulk, remained brilliant in full sunlight.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Dec. 24, 2005, at a distance of approximately 286,000
kilometers (178,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 13 kilometers
(8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
