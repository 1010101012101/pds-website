**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft watches a thin, bright sliver emerge from the hazy
limb of Saturn. In one minute, the sliver ballooned into the full disk of
Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across), which coasted silently into
the black sky.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than
a degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 26, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is about 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
