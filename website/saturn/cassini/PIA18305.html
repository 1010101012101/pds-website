Much as its name implies, tiny Epimetheus (Greek for hindsight) was discovered
in hindsight. Astronomers originally thought that Janus and Epithemeus were
the same object. Only later did astronomers realize that there are in fact two
bodies sharing the same orbit.

Janus (111 miles or 179 kilometers across) and Epimetheus (70 miles or 113
kilometers) have the same average distance from Saturn, but they take turns
being a little closer or a little farther from Saturn, swapping positions
approximately every 4 years. See
[PIA08348](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08348) for more.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 29 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 1, 2015.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.8 million miles (2.9
million kilometers) from Epimetheus and at a Sun-Epimetheus-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 89 degrees. Image scale is 11 miles (17 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
