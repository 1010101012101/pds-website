Atlas is seen in this image with several background stars as the moon orbits
within the Roche Division-- the region between Saturn's A and F rings.

Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across) is in the top left quadrant of the
image. For higher-resolution images of this saucer shaped moon, see
[PIA08405](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08405).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 65 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March 23, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 913,000 kilometers (567,000 miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 105 degrees. Image scale is 5
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
