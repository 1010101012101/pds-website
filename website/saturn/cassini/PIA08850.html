**Caption:**

Saturn's entire main ring system spreads out below Cassini in this night
side view, which shows the rings disappearing into the planet's shadow.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 48 degrees
above the ringplane. In the upper right corner lies the darkened northern
hemisphere; beneath it, the lit side of the rings casts reflected
sunlight, or ringshine, onto southern latitudes, lighting up the skies
there. A sliver of light from Saturn's sunlit side pierces the top of the
image.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Dec. 5, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.2
million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 69
kilometers (43 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
