**Caption:**

Saturn's sunlit rings gleam in the blackness as two icy moons cruise past 
in the foreground.

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is a small crescent near 
upper left; Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) is a speck above 
the F ring, near center. Janus was brightened slightly for visibility.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 5 degrees 
below the ringplane.

This image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Nov. 7, 2006, at a distance of approximately 1.1 
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 139 degrees. Image scale on the 
sky at the distance of Saturn is 63 kilometers (39 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
