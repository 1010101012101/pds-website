This false-color mosaic from NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows the tail of
Saturn's huge northern storm.

See [PIA14905](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14905) to learn
more about this storm and watch its development over several months. Earlier
in the Cassini mission, the spacecraft chronicled a smaller storm in the
southern hemisphere called the "Dragon Storm." See PIA06197 to learn more
about that storm and to see a similar, false-color view.

The head of the storm is beyond the horizon in this view. Saturn's atmosphere
and its rings are shown here in a false color composite made from 12 images
taken in near- infrared light through filters that are sensitive to varying
degrees of methane absorption. Red and orange colors in this view indicate
clouds that are deep in the atmosphere. Yellow and green colors, most
noticeable near the top of the view, indicate intermediate clouds. White and
blue indicate high clouds and haze. The rings appear as a thin horizontal line
of bright blue because they are outside of the atmosphere and not affected by
methane absorption.

The oval in the upper left of this image that appears slightly blue is the
same hole in the deep clouds of the planet's atmosphere that can be seen near
the tail in a larger false-color mosaic,
[PIA14905](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14905). The blue color
comes from the high haze overlying the hole.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ring plane. The shadow of the moon Enceladus is visible on the planet in
the lower left of the image.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a
combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light. The images filtered at 890 nanometers are projected as blue. The images
filtered at 728 nanometers are projected as green, and images filtered at 752
nanometers are projected as red.

The images were taken on Jan. 12, 2011, over about one hour at a distance of
approximately 684,000 miles (1.1 million kilometers) from Saturn and at a sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 52 degrees. The images were re-projected
to the same viewing geometry, so that scale in this final mosaic is 76 miles
(122 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
