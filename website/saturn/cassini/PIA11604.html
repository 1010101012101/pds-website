**Caption:**

Saturn's moons Prometheus and Pan cast a pair of shadows on the A ring in
this image taken shortly after the planet's August 2009 equinox.

Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) orbits in the Encke Gap of the A
ring, and it can be seen casting a shadow to the right of and a little
below Prometheus' shadow in this image.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles
across) periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring, and the
moon's handiwork can be seen above the moon in this image. To learn more
and to watch a movie of this process, see [PIA08397](PIA08397.html).

Kinky, discontinuous ringlets in the Encke Gap are also visible at the
bottom of the image. See [PIA11676](PIA11676.html) to learn more.


The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the shadows
of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane. The main rings have been brightened relative
to the F-ring to increase visibility.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 21, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
