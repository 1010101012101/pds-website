Two moons regard each other across a vast distance in this view from the
Cassini spacecraft.

Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across, at bottom) is easily identified by
its prominent crater, Herschel. Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across)
sits beyond the rings, appearing almost to rest upon them.

This view was obtained from a perspective nearly edge-on with the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 6, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.6 million kilometers
(1.6 million miles) from Mimas and 3.2 million kilometers (2 million miles)
from Rhea. Image scale is 15 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel on Mimas and 19
kilometers (12 miles) per pixel on Rhea.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
