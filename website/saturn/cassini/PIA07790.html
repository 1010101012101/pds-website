**Caption:**

These figures show four propeller-shaped structures discovered by the 
Cassini spacecraft in close-up images of Saturn's A ring.

The propellers are about 5 kilometers (3 miles) long from tip to tip, and 
the radial offset (the "leading" dash is slightly closer to Saturn) is 
about 300 meters (1,000 feet). See [PIA07791](PIA07791.html) and [PIA07792](PIA07792.html) for 
additional images and information about these features.

The figures were cropped from two original Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle 
camera images and magnified for visibility. The images were then 
re-projected so that orbital motion is to the left and Saturn is up. The 
unseen moonlets lie in the center of each structure. The figures were 
cropped from two original Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera images, 
taken during Saturn orbit insertion on July 1, 2004, and magnified for 
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
