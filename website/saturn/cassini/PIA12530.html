Pan is nearly lost within Saturn's rings in this view that captures a small
section of the rings from just above the ringplane.

Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) appears a small bright dot on the far
side of the rings near the middle top of the image. Pan orbits in the Encke
Gap of the A ring. See
[PIA11625](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11625) to see Pan
casting a shadow on the ring around the time of Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

A bright spoke also can be seen on the far right center of the image. To learn
about spokes, see
[PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144) and
[PIA08288](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08288).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 7, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Pan and at a Sun-Pan-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 98 degrees. Image scale is 13 kilometers (8
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
