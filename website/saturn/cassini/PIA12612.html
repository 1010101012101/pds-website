This Cassini spacecraft image holds an unseen treasure orbiting within the
bright arc of Saturn's G ring: the tiny moonlet Aegaeon.

The moonlet itself is too small to be seen within the arc pictured here, but
is thought to be the source of the debris forming the bright arc in the lower
right portion of the G ring in this image. See
[PIA11148](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11148) to learn more
about tiny Aegaeon (formerly known as S/2008 S 1). This view looks toward the
southern, unilluminated side of the rings from about 4 degrees below the
ringplane. Many background stars are visible elongated by the motion of the
spacecraft during the image's exposure.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 24, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
