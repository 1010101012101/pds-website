The Cassini spacecraft captures Saturn's main rings in a study of light and
dark.

A bright knot is visible in the F ring near upper left. Ring scientists think
features like this can be created when a small moonlet collides with the
ring's core, leading to collisions that scatter fine, icy particles (see
[PIA08290](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08290)).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 16
degrees above the ringplane. The edge of Saturn's shadow forms a dark wedge on
the rings at right.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Sept. 22, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (743,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 68 kilometers
(42 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
