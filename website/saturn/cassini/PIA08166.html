**Caption:**

Dreamy colors ranging from pale rose to butterscotch to sapphire give this 
utterly inhospitable gas planet a romantic appeal. Shadows of the rings 
caress the northern latitudes whose blue color is presumed to be a 
seasonal effect.

Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) hugs the ringplane right 
of center.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this color view, which approximates what the human eye would see. 
The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 
16, 2006 at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 
million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle 
of 102 degrees. Image scale is 120 kilometers (75 miles) per pixel on 
Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
