Saturn's moon Prometheus, orbiting near the streamer-channels it has created
in the thin F ring, casts a shadow on the A ring in this image taken a little
more than a week after the planet's August 2009 equinox.

Potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across) periodically
creates streamer-channels in the F ring, and the moon's handiwork can be seen
on the left of the image. To learn more and to watch a movie of this process,
see [PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 21, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 13
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
