**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Helene, seen here with Saturn's nearly edge-on rings, orbits 
60 degrees ahead of Dione and is called a "Trojan" moon. The tiny moon 
Polydeuces (about 5 kilometers or 3 miles across, recently discovered by 
Cassini imaging scientists) is also a Dione Trojan, orbiting 60 degrees 
behind. Helene is 32 kilometers (20 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on March 12, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2 
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Helene and at a 
Sun-Helene-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 90 degrees. Resolution in the 
original image was 10 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
