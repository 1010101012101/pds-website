**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft catches a hint of topography on Janus, which orbits
Saturn just outside the planet's narrow F ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 12
degrees above the ringplane. Janus is 179 kilometers (111 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on April 14, 2008. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (930,000 miles) from
Janus and at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 22 degrees. Image
scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
