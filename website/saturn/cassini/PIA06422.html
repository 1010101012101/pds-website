**Caption:**

Saturn and its rings are prominently shown in this color image, along
with three of Saturn's smaller moons. From left to right, they are
Prometheus, Pandora and Janus.

Prometheus and Pandora are often called the "F ring shepherds" as they
control and interact with Saturn's interesting F ring, seen between them.

This image was taken on June 18, 2004, with the Cassini spacecraft narrow
angle camera 8.2 million kilometers (5.1 million miles) from Saturn. It
was created using the red, green, and blue filters. Contrast has been
enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
