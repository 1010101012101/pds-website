Two small but stately moons appear above and below the rings on the left of
this image, serving to visually offset the dominance of Saturn on the
picture's right.

Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) is on the far left, below the
rings in the image. Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) appears as
a small bright dot near the middle left.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 26,
2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 98 degrees. Image scale is 131
kilometers (81 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
