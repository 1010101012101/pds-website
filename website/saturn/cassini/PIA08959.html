**Caption:**

Saturn's A ring displays a marked asymmetry in brightness between the
region nearer to the Cassini spacecraft and the region farther from it.
The A ring is the broad, bright section of the rings outside of the dark B
ring. The asymmetry may help scientists understand various properties of
the rings, such as the sizes of the particles and their arrangement into
clumps.

The rings' dark shadows hug Saturn's northern hemisphere.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 7
degrees above the ringplane. The planet is overexposed in this
observation, which was designed to capture details in the rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on May 14, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.8
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 101
kilometers (63 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL.  The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
