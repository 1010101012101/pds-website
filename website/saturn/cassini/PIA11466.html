**Caption:**

A bright narrow ring dominates this view of the Cassini Division
separating Saturn's A and B rings.

The brightest ringlet in this image has been spotted by Cassini before,
and is known to be eccentric. And to the right of the division, an
incomplete arc of bright material scores the edge of the outer B ring, a
region markedly disturbed and shaped by the action of a strong
gravitational resonance with the moon Mimas. Cassini scientists are
presently investigating the shape and behavior of outer B ring, including
the feature seen here, to understand how rings respond to strong external
perturbations.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 3 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 25, 2009. The view was acquired at
a distance of approximately 822,000 kilometers (511,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 154 degrees. Image
scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
