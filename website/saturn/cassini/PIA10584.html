**Caption:**

At first glance, it seems Epimetheus is the lone moon orbiting Saturn in 
this image, but a closer inspection reveals a couple of companions in the 
rings.

Circling brightly outside the rings in the lower right of the image is 
Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across). On the left of the image 
is tiny Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across), a small gray dot cutting 
through the Encke Gap of the outer A ring. Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 
miles across) is an even fainter dot orbiting between the A ring and the 
thin F ring in the lower central part of the image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 16 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 20, 2009. The view was 
acquired at a distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (620,000 
miles) from Atlas and at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 33 
degrees. Image scale is 64 kilometers (40 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
