**Caption:**

The shadow of the moon Mimas extends elegantly across Saturn's A and F
rings.

As Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox, the planet's moons cast
shadows onto the rings. To learn more about this special time and to see a
movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html). Two
background stars are visible in the image. Mimas is not shown.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 62 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 7, 2009. The view was acquired at
a distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 101 degrees.
Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
