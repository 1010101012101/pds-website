The moons Pan (near center) and Daphnis (lower center) cruise through the
Encke and Keeler gaps, respectively.

The edge waves used to discover Daphnis can be seen here as the brightening on
either side of the moon. And although the edge waves Pan raises in the Encke
gap are not visible here, the wakes caused by Pan's disturbance of the rings
are clearly visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 20, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.195 million
kilometers (742,000 miles) from Pan and at a Sun-Pan-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 29 degrees. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
