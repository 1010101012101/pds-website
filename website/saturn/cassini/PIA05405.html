**Caption:**

This image shows several dark storms confined to a region below 30
degrees south latitude in Saturn's atmosphere. This turbulent region has
produced quite a few storms during Cassini's approach to Saturn,
including some that have merged. A number of other interesting
smaller-scale atmospheric features are also becoming visible.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on
May 11, 2004, from a distance of 26.4 million kilometers (16.4 million
miles) from Saturn through a filter centered at 750 nanometers. The image
scale is 157 kilometers (98 miles) per pixel. Contrast in the image was
enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
