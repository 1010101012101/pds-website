This image shows several dark storms confined to a region below 30 degrees
south latitude in Saturn's atmosphere. This turbulent region has produced
quite a few storms during Cassini's approach to Saturn, including some that
have merged. A number of other interesting smaller-scale atmospheric features
are also becoming visible.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on May 11,
2004, from a distance of 26.4 million kilometers (16.4 million miles) from
Saturn through a filter centered at 750 nanometers. The image scale is 157
kilometers (98 miles) per pixel. Contrast in the image was enhanced to aid
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
