The Cassini spacecraft looks toward high northern latitudes on Saturn and the
wild cloud forms that swirl there.

The view was taken from about 23 degrees above the ringplane and looks toward
the unilluminated side of the rings.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 17,
2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (791,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
