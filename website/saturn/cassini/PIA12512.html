**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft takes a look at Saturn's diffuse E ring which is
formed from icy material spewing out of the south pole of the moon
Enceladus.

See [PIA08921](PIA08921.html) to learn more about how Enceladus creates the E ring.
The E ring is seen nearly edge-on from slightly above the northern side of
Saturn's ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Oct. 23, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 149 kilometers (92 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate,
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is
based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
