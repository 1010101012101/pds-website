**Caption:**

Dione floats past, with Saturn's rings beyond.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles
across). North is up. The darker terrain on the moon's trailing side is partly visible here,
along with one of the bright linea -- the bright fractures that crisscross Dione's trailing
side.

The view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from less than a degree below the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 26, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 883,000
kilometers (549,000 miles) from Dione. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations
center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
