A pair of Saturn's small moons orbit near the planet's rings, which appear
well illuminated in this Cassini spacecraft view.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) is near the center of the image
and is farther than the rings from Cassini. Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50
miles across) is on the left. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side
of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 17, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.7 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from Janus and Pandora. Image scale
is 16 kilometers (10 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
