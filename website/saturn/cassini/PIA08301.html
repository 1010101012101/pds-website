**Caption:**

Saturn's rings are dark and elusive in this view from high above the
ringplane, but their shadows on the planet give them away.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 37 degrees
above the ringplane. The D, C, and B rings and the innermost A ring fill
this view, although the rings are quite dark and difficult to see. Their
structure is far clearer on the planet at right. Near upper right is a
dot-like shadow, likely that of the small moon Janus.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Sept. 27, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1
million kilometers (600,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 137 degrees. Image scale is 58
kilometers (36 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
