**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks to the night side of Saturn and its rings for
a view that includes Dione.

Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is in the top right of the
image. Tiny Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) can also be seen
outside the F ring near the center of the image. Dione was overexposed in
this image and has been dimmed by a factor of seven.

This view looks toward the sunlit, northern side of the rings from about
12 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Sept.
22, 2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 742 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
