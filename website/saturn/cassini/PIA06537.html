**Caption:**

Saturn's inner C ring spreads across the field of view, showing the 
characteristic plateau and wave-like structure for which it is famed. 

The center of this image shows an area approximately 75,000 kilometers 
(46,600 miles) from Saturn. The dark gap through the middle of the frame 
is the Colombo gap which houses the bright, narrow, eccentric Colombo 
ringlet, in resonance with the moon Titan.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on 
Oct. 29, 2004, at a distance of about 842,000 (523,000 miles) from 
Saturn. The image scale is 4.7 kilometers (2.9 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
