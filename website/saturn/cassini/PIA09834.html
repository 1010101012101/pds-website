**Caption:**

Two dark gores in Saturn's F ring demonstrate the gravitational influence 
of the shepherd moon Prometheus. 

The older gore at the top of this view is at a steeper angle than the 
newer addition just above and to the left of Prometheus, since the former 
has sheared out over the course of an orbit: particles on the inner 
(right) side of the F ring travel faster in the same amount of time than 
the particles on the outer (left) side, leaving the outer particles 
behind.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is lit at left by direct 
sunlight and at right by reflected light from Saturn. The bright, sunlit 
portion of the moon is overexposed.

Two background stars are captured above Prometheus in this view, which 
looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 33 degrees 
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 1, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance 
of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (956,000 miles) from Saturn and at 
a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 62 degrees. Image scale is 9 
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
