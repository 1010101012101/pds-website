Two dark gores in Saturn's F ring demonstrate the gravitational influence of
the shepherd moon Prometheus.

The older gore at the top of this view is at a steeper angle than the newer
addition just above and to the left of Prometheus, since the former has
sheared out over the course of an orbit: particles on the inner (right) side
of the F ring travel faster in the same amount of time than the particles on
the outer (left) side, leaving the outer particles behind.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is lit at left by direct
sunlight and at right by reflected light from Saturn. The bright, sunlit
portion of the moon is overexposed.

Two background stars are captured above Prometheus in this view, which looks
toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 33 degrees above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 1, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.5 million kilometers (956,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 62 degrees. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
