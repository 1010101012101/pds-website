**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft gazes toward a distant star as Saturn's rings slip 
past in the foreground. At upper left is the outer A ring, with its dark 
Keeler Gap. At lower right, a train of bright clumps shuttles past in the 
wispy F ring.

A temporal sequence of images like this allow Cassini scientists to 
correlate features in the rings with stellar occultation data acquired by 
other instruments. As the star passes behind the rings, the changes in its 
brightness indicate how much empty space is between particles at different 
locations on the rings.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 56 degrees 
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Dec. 30, 2006 at a distance of approximately 
633,440 kilometers (393,686 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 4 
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
