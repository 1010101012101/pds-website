Similar to many of the small, inner moons of Saturn, Prometheus points its
long axis at Saturn as if giving us directions to the planet.

Prometheus (53 miles or 86 kilometers across), like most small moons, is not
spherical. Astronomers think that the shapes of these moons hold clues to
their origins and evolutions.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 37 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 10, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 621,000 miles (1 million
kilometers) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 34 degrees. Image scale is 4 miles (6 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
