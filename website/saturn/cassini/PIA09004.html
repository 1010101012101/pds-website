**Caption:**

Three of Saturn's brood are captured near the rings in this view from the
Cassini spacecraft. Together they showcase the rich variety of worlds
found in the Saturn system.

Pictured here are: Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across) at
upper left, Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across) at right and
Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) just above the rings left of
center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 2
degrees above the ringplane. The planet is overexposed in this view.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on June 24, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.8
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 183
kilometers (114 miles) per pixel on Titan, 132 kilometers (82 miles) per
pixel on Dione and 115 kilometers (71 miles) per pixel at the distance of
Janus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
