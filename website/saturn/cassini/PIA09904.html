**Caption:**

A trio of large storms embraces in Saturn's high north. The three
prominent vortices seen here are each wide enough to span the distance
from New York City to Denver, or from London to Moscow.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 30
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 17, 2008 using a spectral filter
sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 939 nanometers. The
view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers
(899,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 83 kilometers (52 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
