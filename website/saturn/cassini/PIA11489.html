**Caption:**

The exquisitely formed shadow of the moon Mimas graces Saturn's A ring in 
this Cassini portrait.

Saturn's moons cast shadows onto the rings as the planet approaches its 
August 2009 equinox. To learn more about this special time and to see a 
movie of a moon's shadow moving across the rings, see [PIA11651](PIA11651.html). 

Mimas is not shown in this image, but Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 
miles across) is visible in the bottom of the image between the A ring and 
the thin F ring. Other bright specks in the image are background stars.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 60 
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the 
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 30, 2009. The view was 
acquired at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (746,000 
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 69 
degrees. Image scale is 69 kilometers (43 miles) per pixel.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 1 
degree above the ringplane. The rings and Pandora have been brightened 
relative to the other moons to enhance visibility. The image was taken in 
green light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 11, 
2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4 million 
kilometers (870,000 miles) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 21 degrees. Image scale on Tethys is about 82 kilometers 
pixels per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
