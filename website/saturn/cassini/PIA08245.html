**Caption:**

Bright ringlets and dark gaps at the inner edge of the C ring sweep across
this scene. The C ring contains numerous "plateaus" -- broad ring regions
that are bright and surrounded by fainter material.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on July 23, 2006. The view was captured from 14
degrees below the ring plane and at a distance of approximately 272,000
kilometers (169,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 1 kilometer (0.6
mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
