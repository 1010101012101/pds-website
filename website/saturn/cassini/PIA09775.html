**Caption:**

From a low angle above Saturn's rings, the Cassini spacecraft's view of an 
icy moon is partly obscured.

The view looks toward Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) 
across the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a degree above 
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 26, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance 
of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Enceladus. 
Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
