From a low angle above Saturn's rings, the Cassini spacecraft's view of an icy
moon is partly obscured.

The view looks toward Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) across
the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a degree above the
ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 26, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Enceladus. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
