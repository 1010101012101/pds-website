The Cassini spacecraft captures eight new propeller-like features within
Saturn's A ring in what may be the propeller "hot zone" of Saturn's rings.

Propeller features form around small moonlets that are not massive enough to
clear out ring material, but are still able to pull smaller ring particles
into a shape reminiscent of an airplane propeller. Scientists believe that
propellers represent moonlet wakes, which are denser than the surrounding ring
material and appear bright in the images.

Propellers were first discovered in Cassini images taken during Saturn orbit
insertion in 2004. This new image is from a more extensive study of the full A
ring and provides evidence that these features are not distributed evenly as
previously thought, but are instead grouped in a 3,000 kilometer-wide (1,860
mile) propeller belt.

This image shows four new propellers and was put together from images in the
Planetary Data System, a web site which archives and distributes scientific
data from NASA planetary missions. The largest propeller seen here is noted in
the white dashed box, and it indicates the presence of a 150-meter (490-foot)
moonlet. The size is inferred from the radial separation of the propeller
wings. The propeller is seen in another image and is shown in the upper left
box. The reappearance of the propellers clearly demonstrates the orbital
motion of the propellers. The region enclosed in the red box is zoomed and
shown in the top panel of
[PIA10080](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10080). Three
additional propellers are noted with white dashed circles on the right. Very
bright and round spots are artifacts. But some of the bright elongated and
non-saturated streaks could be smaller propellers that are not resolved in the
image.

This view is made up of two images from a set of 26 images with a complete
radial coverage of the A ring and part of the Cassini division taken during an
occultation of the star Antares (alpha Scorpii; brightest spot on top) on Aug.
20, 2005.

In this clear filter image, the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera
observed the unlit side of the rings, with a phase angle of 126 degrees. The
images were taken at 1 minute intervals with 0.05 seconds exposure time. Image
resolution is 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
