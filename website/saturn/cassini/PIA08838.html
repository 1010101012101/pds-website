**Caption:**

Only Cassini could provide this enchanting, natural color view of crescent 
Saturn, which gazes down onto the unlit side of the planet's spectacular 
rings. The robotic ship plies the peaceful black seas around the ringed 
giant, searching for answers to the many questions posed by the 
inquisitive minds of Earth.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 19 degrees 
above the ringplane. The view of Saturn is through the dark rings at 
bottom; the rings cast shadows onto the northern hemisphere at top.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to 
create this natural color view. The images were taken with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 4, 2006 at a distance of 
approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn and at 
a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 162 degrees. Image scale is 97 
kilometers (61 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
