**Caption:**

This image captures several important targets of the Cassini mission: 
icy moons, rings, and the gaps in the rings that may contain small 
undiscovered moons.

Mimas (398 kilometers, or 247 miles across) is easily seen near lower 
right. Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across) is visible left 
of center.

The 4,800-kilometer- (2,980-mile-) wide Cassini division is the dark 
swath at upper left. The Encke Gap (325 kilometers, or 202 miles wide) 
is visible as a dark curve near the edge of the A ring. The thin F ring 
is seen here, exterior to the main rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow 
angle camera on Sept. 10, 2004, at a distance of 8.9 million kilometers 
(5.5 million miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft or phase, 
angle of 84 degrees. The image scale is 53 kilometers (33 miles) per 
pixel. The image was magnified by a factor of four to aid visibility. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, 
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were 
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at 
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
