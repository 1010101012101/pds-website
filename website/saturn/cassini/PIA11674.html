**Caption:**

The bright streaks visible in these Cassini images taken during Saturn's
August 2009 equinox are exciting evidence of a constant rain of
interplanetary projectiles onto the planet's rings.

Objects, each estimated to be one meter (3 feet) in size and traveling
tens of kilometers per second (tens of thousands of miles per hour),
likely smashed into the rings and created elevated clouds of tiny
particles that have been sheared out, or elongated and tilted, by orbital
motion into bright streaks.

The image on the left shows an impact in the A ring. The streak stretches
from the right of the image to the middle, and it does not quite follow
the arc of the rings. The brightest part of that streak is 5,000
kilometers (3,100 miles) long (its azimuthal dimension) and 200 kilometers
(120 miles) wide (its radial extent, tip to tip) in this image.

The image on the right shows an impact into the C ring. This streak is
much smaller than the A ring streak, and it appears on the right of the
image. The brightest part of this streak is 200 kilometers (120 miles)
long (its azimuthal dimension) and 10 kilometers (6 miles) wide (its
radial dimension, tip to tip) in this image.

By the brightness and dimensions of the streaks, scientists estimate the
impactor sizes at roughly one meter (3 feet), and the elapsed time since
impact at one to two days. These equinox data lend more confidence to a
Cassini imaging observation made in 2005 of similar streaks seen in the C
ring (see [PIA11675](PIA11675.html)). All together, these
observations constitute the visual confirmation of a long-held belief that
bits of interplanetary debris continually rain down on Saturn's rings and
contribute to the rings' erosion and evolution.

Although the phase angle of these images is not the best for seeing clouds
of small particles, these ejecta clouds are easily seen because very
little sunlight is falling on the rings during the exceedingly low
sun-angle condition prevalent during the four days surrounding exact
Saturn equinox. Exact equinox is when the sun is directly overhead at the
equator. A cloud of dust rising above the dark ring plane is more directly
catching the sun's rays, and is hence well lit and easily visible by
contrast. When the ring background is at its usual brightness, impacts
such as these are very difficult to detect.

The view of the A ring streak on the left looks toward the northern side
of the rings from about 20 degrees above the ring plane. The image was
taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Aug. 13, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 1.2
million kilometers (746,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 87 degrees. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4
miles) per pixel.

The view of the C ring streak on the right looks toward the southern side
of the rings from about 22 degrees below the ring plane. The image was
taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
Aug. 11, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
263,000 kilometers (164,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 135 degrees. Image scale is 1 kilometer
(4,007 feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
