**Caption:**

Cassini instruments provide complementary information about the structure 
of Saturn's rings. Narrow and wide angle cameras provide images in the 
visible region of the electromagnetic, spectrum much like a digital camera 
does. The images have information about how the ring structure differs 
both with distance from the planet and with position around the equatorial 
circle. However, resolution is usually limited to few kilometers at best.

Radio and stellar occultations of the rings also provide important 
information about ring structure, but only along a one-dimensional track 
through the rings. The radial resolution can be as fine as 50 meters (164 
feet). An "image" is then constructed by assuming circular symmetry over 
the ring region of interest. Color is usually added to encode other 
information related to the observed structure.

This image compares structure of Saturn's rings observed by these two 
approaches. The upper half is a natural color mosaic of images by the 
Cassini narrow-angle camera (see [PIA06175](PIA06175.html)). The bottom simulated 
images is constructed from a radio occultation observation conducted on 
May 3, 2005. Color in the lower image is used to represent information 
about ring particle sizes. For another view created using this process 
(see [PIA07872](PIA07872.html)). 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency.  The Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology 
in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission 
Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter was designed, 
developed and assembled at JPL.  The radio science team is based 
at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
