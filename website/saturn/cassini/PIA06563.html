**Caption:**

The sunlit face of Saturn's rings shows magnificent detail in this image 
taken in near infrared light. Most notable is the transition in brightness 
toward the outer edges of the image, due to differences in composition and 
ring particle density. The image was obtained from Cassini's vantage point 
beneath the ring plane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on 
Dec. 12, 2004, at a distance of 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) 
from Saturn, through a broadband filter sensitive to wavelengths of 
infrared light centered at 862 nanometers. The image scale is about 11 
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, 
Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were 
designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at 
the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
