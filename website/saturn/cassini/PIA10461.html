As Prometheus pulls away from an encounter with Saturn's F ring, its immediate
effects on the ring material are clear. The moon has pulled toward it a faint
streamer of material from the inner, flanking ringlet and even created a
modest bulge in the ring's bright core.

Above the moon in this image is the feature created during the previous
passage of Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across). The older streamer
feature has sheared diagonally over the course of an orbit, becoming a dark
channel. This too is the fate of the newly created streamer.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 14 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 6, 2008. The view was obtained at a
distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (635,000 miles) from Prometheus
and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 32 degrees. Image scale
is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
