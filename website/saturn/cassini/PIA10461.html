**Caption:**

As Prometheus pulls away from an encounter with Saturn's F ring, its 
immediate effects on the ring material are clear. The moon has pulled 
toward it a faint streamer of material from the inner, flanking ringlet 
and even created a modest bulge in the ring's bright core.

Above the moon in this image is the feature created during the previous 
passage of Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across). The older 
streamer feature has sheared diagonally over the course of an orbit, 
becoming a dark channel. This too is the fate of the newly created 
streamer.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 14 degrees 
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini 
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 6, 2008. The view was obtained at a 
distance of approximately 1 million kilometers (635,000 miles) from 
Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 32 
degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
