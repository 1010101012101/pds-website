The moon Tethys stands out as a tiny crescent of light in front of the dark of
Saturn's night side.

Tethys (1,062 kilometers, or 660 miles across) can be seen above the ringplane
on the far right of the image. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit
side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 27,
2009 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 99 degrees. Image scale is 135
kilometers (84 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
