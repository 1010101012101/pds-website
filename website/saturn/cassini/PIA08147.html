**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks up from beneath the ringplane to spy Atlas 
hugging the outer edge of the A ring, above center.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 23, 2006, at a distance of approximately 1.1 
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles 
across). The image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel on Atlas.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
