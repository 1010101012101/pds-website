**Caption:**

This close-up of the inner edge of the Cassini Division shows an enormous 
amount of structure, including a grainy texture in the bright outer B ring 
material near the gap edge.

An extreme enhancement of the original image, presented at right, reveals 
the grainy region with greater clarity.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 54 degrees 
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Nov. 8, 2006 at a distance of approximately 378,000 
kilometers (235,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 68 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
