**Caption:**

The simple beauty of Saturn's rings&mdash;curving lines of varied shades
that have surrounded the planet for eons&mdash;is captured in visible
light. The white edge of the B ring and the black of the Huygens Gap are
on the left.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 7 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 14, 2009. The view was obtained at
a distance of approximately 551,000 kilometers (343,000 miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 155 degrees. Image
scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
