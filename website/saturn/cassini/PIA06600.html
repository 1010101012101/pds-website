Intriguing features resembling drapes and kinks are visible in this Cassini
view of Saturn's thin F ring. Several distinct ringlets are present, in
addition to the bright, knotted core of the ring.

The obvious structure in the ring and its strands has been caused by
Prometheus, the inner F ring shepherd moon that recently swept past this
region. (Prometheus is about 10 degrees ahead of the F ring material in this
image). These types of features were first seen in images taken just after
Cassini entered into orbit around Saturn. The gravitational interaction of
Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) on the ring pulls material out
the ring once every orbit (every 14.7 hours) as the moon gets close to the
ring and its strands.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan.
19, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers (1.2 million
miles) from Saturn through a filter sensitive to polarized visible light.
Resolution in the original image was 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel. The
image was contrast-enhanced and magnified by a factor of two to aid
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
