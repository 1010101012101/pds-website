**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft views the gauzy C ring of Saturn, with the
cloud-streaked planet providing a dramatic backdrop.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 32
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 5, 2008. The view was
obtained at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers (960,000
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-ring-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 46
degrees. Image scale is about 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
