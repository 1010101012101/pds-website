**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft spies Enceladus and Epimetheus near the limb of Saturn.

Geologically active Enceladus is 505 kilometers (314 miles) across; smaller, more
irregularly shaped Epimetheus is 116 kilometers (72 miles) across.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a degree above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in polarized green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 27, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 1.4
million kilometers (857,000 miles) from Enceladus. Epimetheus is 91,000 kilometers
(57,000 miles) farther away from Cassini here. Image scale is about 8 kilometers (5 miles)
per pixel on both moons.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's
Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard
cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations
center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
