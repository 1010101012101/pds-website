**Caption:**

Recent Cassini images of Saturn's moon Enceladus backlit by the sun show
the fountain-like sources of the fine spray of material that towers over
the south polar region. This image was taken looking more or less
broadside at the "tiger stripe" fractures observed in earlier Enceladus
images. It shows discrete plumes of a variety of apparent sizes above the
limb of the moon.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
