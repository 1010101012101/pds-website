Recent Cassini images of Saturn's moon Enceladus backlit by the sun show the
fountain-like sources of the fine spray of material that towers over the south
polar region. This image was taken looking more or less broadside at the
"tiger stripe" fractures observed in earlier Enceladus images. It shows
discrete plumes of a variety of apparent sizes above the limb of the moon.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
