This artist's rendering shows a cross-section of the ice shell immediately
beneath one of Enceladus' geyser-active fractures, illustrating the physical
and thermal structure and the processes ongoing below and at the surface.
Narrow cracks extend upward from the sub-surface sea all the way to the
surface, through both ductile and brittle layers of the ice shell (see
[PIA17190](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17190)). Liquid water
under pressure fills the cracks, keeping them open even through the ductile
layer and providing a conduit for vapor and sea water to reach the near-
surface. Other processes, such as volatile exsolution of gases, can drive
vapor and water droplets all the way to the surface, forming geysers and
condensing close to the surface, depositing latent heat. This heat is observed
by Cassini's long-wavelength infrared instruments as the small-scale hot spots
(dozens of feet, or tens of meters, in size) surrounding each geyser.

The subsurface regions immediately surrounding the cracks bearing water and
vapor are expected to be warm. Regional heating from tidal flexing is also
expected to be present, but is so far undetected.

The illustration presents important new details of the geysering process as
reported in a paper by Porco, DiNino, and Nimmo, and published in the online
version of the _Astronomical Journal_ in July 2014:
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-6256/148/3/45>.

A companion paper, by Nimmo _et al_. is available at:

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colorado.
