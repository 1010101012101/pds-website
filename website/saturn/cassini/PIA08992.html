A surge in brightness appears on the rings directly opposite the Sun from the
Cassini spacecraft. This "opposition surge" travels across the rings as the
spacecraft watches (see
[PIA08267](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08267)).

See [PIA08247](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08247) for a
detailed explanation of the opposition effect.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 9 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on June 12, 2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 853 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 524,374 kilometers (325,830 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 31 kilometers (19 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
