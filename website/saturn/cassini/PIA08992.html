**Caption:**

A surge in brightness appears on the rings directly opposite the Sun from
the Cassini spacecraft. This "opposition surge" travels across the rings
as the spacecraft watches (see [PIA08267](PIA08267.html)).

See [PIA08247](PIA08247.html) for a detailed explanation of the opposition effect.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 9 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on June 12, 2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to
wavelengths of infrared light centered at 853 nanometers. The view was
acquired at a distance of approximately 524,374 kilometers (325,830 miles)
from Saturn. Image scale is 31 kilometers (19 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
