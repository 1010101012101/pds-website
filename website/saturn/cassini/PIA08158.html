The Cassini spacecraft looks toward the Saturnian horizon as Dione and Janus
glide past.

A few craters are visible on Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles across).
Janus (181 kilometers, or113 miles across) is slightly blurred due to its
motion during the exposure.

The rings appear essentially edge-on in this view, as the Cassini spacecraft
continues its recent activities close to the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on March
10, 2006, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered
at 750 nanometers. The image was acquired at a distance of approximately 2.9
million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 17
kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
