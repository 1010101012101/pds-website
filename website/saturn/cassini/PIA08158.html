**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft looks toward the Saturnian horizon as Dione and 
Janus glide past.

A few craters are visible on Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 miles 
across). Janus (181 kilometers, or113 miles across) is slightly blurred 
due to its motion during the exposure.

The rings appear essentially edge-on in this view, as the Cassini 
spacecraft continues its recent activities close to the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on 
March 10, 2006, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light 
centered at 750 nanometers. The image was acquired at a distance of 
approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn. The 
image scale is 17 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
