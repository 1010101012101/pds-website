**Caption:**

The brilliant core of the F ring displays a breakaway clump of material,
possibly related to the other objects the Cassini spacecraft has witnessed
in the dynamic ring in the past few years of observations.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 58 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Feb. 10, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7
million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
