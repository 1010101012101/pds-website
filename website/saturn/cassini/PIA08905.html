The brilliant core of the F ring displays a breakaway clump of material,
possibly related to the other objects the Cassini spacecraft has witnessed in
the dynamic ring in the past few years of observations.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 58 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 10, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
