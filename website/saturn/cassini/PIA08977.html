Cassini gazes down toward Saturn's unilluminated ringplane to find Janus
hugging the outer edge of rings.

This view looks toward the rings from about three degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 29, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers
(900,000 miles) from Janus. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
