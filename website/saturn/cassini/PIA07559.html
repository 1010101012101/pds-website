This view shows the unlit face of Saturn's rings, visible via scattered and
transmitted light. In these views, dark regions represent gaps and areas of
higher particle densities, while brighter regions are filled with less dense
concentrations of ring particles.

The dim right side of the image contains nearly the entire C ring. The
brighter region in the middle is the inner B ring, while the darkest part
represents the dense outer B Ring. The Cassini Division and the innermost part
of the A ring are at the upper-left.

Saturn's shadow carves a dark triangle out of the lower right corner of this
image.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on June 8, 2005, at a distance of approximately 433,000 kilometers
(269,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 22 kilometers (14 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
