**Caption:**

In this magnificent view, delicate haze layers high in the atmosphere 
encircle the oblate figure of Saturn. A special combination of spectral 
filters used for this image makes the high haze become visible. A 
methane-sensitive filter (centered at 889 nanometers) makes high altitude 
features stand out, while a polarizing filter makes small haze particles 
appear bright.

Methane in the atmosphere absorbs light with wavelengths around 889 
nanometers as it travels deeper into the gas planet, thus bright areas in 
this image must represent reflective material at higher altitudes. Small 
particles or individual molecules scatter light quite effectively to a 
polarization of 90 degrees, which this polarizing filter is sensitive to. 
Thus, high altitude haze layers appear bright in this view.

The small blob of light at far right is Dione (1,126 kilometers, or 700 
miles across).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Dec. 
5, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) 
 from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 100 degrees. 
The image scale is 169 kilometers (105 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
