**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft captures an intriguing feature in the perturbed
core of Saturn's F ring.

The feature is similar in appearance to the one captured in [PIA08290](PIA08290.html).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 32
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Dec. 31, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance
of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn and
at a Sun-ring-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 63 degrees. Image scale is 10
kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
