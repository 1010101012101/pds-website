**Caption:**

Several sets of shadows are cast onto the A ring in this image taken about
a week after Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

Near the middle of the image, shadows are cast by vertically extended
clumps in the kinky, discontinuous ringlets of the Encke Gap in the A
ring. These clumps are casting shadows approximately 275 kilometers (170
miles) long, implying a clump height about 600 meters (2,000 feet) above
the ring plane.

In the middle left of the image, the waves created by Daphnis (8
kilometers, 5 miles across) on the edge of the Keeler Gap cast shadows on
the A ring that are about 450 kilometers (280 miles) long, indicating
waves that rise about one kilometer above the ring plane. The moon itself
is not visible at this resolution, but it, too, orbits in the Keeler Gap
of the A ring. Daphnis has an inclined orbit, and its gravitational pull
perturbs the orbits of the particles of the A ring forming the Keeler
Gap's edge and sculpts the edge into waves having both horizontal (radial)
and out-of-plane components. Material on the inner edge of the gap orbits
faster than the moon so that the waves there lead the moon in its orbit.
Material on the outer edge moves slower than the moon, so waves there
trail the moon. See [PIA11654](PIA11654.html) to learn more.

Elsewhere, bending (or vertical) waves in the rings that spiral all the
way around the rings and are generated by external Saturnian satellites
are also casting shadows. The bright "ringlet" passing through the center
of the image is the Mimas 5:3 bending wave, accompanied by a broad and
azimuthally extended dark band of shadow. To the right of this feature is
the Mimas 7:4 bending wave -- another, narrower bending wave feature with
its shadow band. On the left of the image, the dark band between the Encke
and Keeler Gaps, a bit closer to the latter, is the shadow created by the
8:5 Mimas bending wave. See [PIA10501](PIA10501.html) to
learn more.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ring plane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and
after Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years.
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)),
but also the shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves
(e.g., see [PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 11 degrees
above the ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 19, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance
of approximately 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn
and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 116 degrees. Image
scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
