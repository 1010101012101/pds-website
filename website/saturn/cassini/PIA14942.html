This animation depicts the shearing of an initially circular cloud of debris
as a result of the particles in the cloud having differing orbital speeds
around Saturn. After the cloud is formed, each particle within it follows its
own simple orbit. The cloud begins to elongate as particles closer to the
planet orbit at a faster speed than the particles farther from the planet.
Scientists can use the angle the cloud was canted to infer the time elapsed
since it was formed. This method was used to determine the times of the
impacts that created the clouds in Saturn's rings that were captured by NASA's
Cassini spacecraft (see
[PIA14938](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14938) for more
information).
