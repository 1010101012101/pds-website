**Caption:**

The soft, sweeping shadows of Saturn's C ring cover bright patches of 
clouds in the planet's atmosphere. The shadow-throwing rings stretch 
across the view at bottom. The dark inner edge of the B ring is visible 
at top.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of 
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The image was acquired with the 
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 28, 2006 at a distance of 
approximately 340,000 kilometers (211,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale 
is 17 kilometers (10 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
