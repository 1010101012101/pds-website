**Caption:**

This strikingly crisp view shows Atlas heading into Saturn's shadow at
upper left. The moon's basic, elongated shape is easy to detect here.

(See [PIA08233](PIA08233.html) for a different perspective on Atlas.)

Above Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) in the image, a bright
clump in the F ring also heads toward the darkness.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 30 degrees
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Jan. 19, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.2
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Atlas. Image scale is 7 kilometers
(4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
