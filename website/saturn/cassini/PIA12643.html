Saturn's rings occupy the foreground of this image. The small moon Janus
appears to hover above, while the far larger moon Rhea is partially obscured
by the rings.

Janus appears to be located directly over the rings, but the moon is actually
further away, at a range of about 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from
the Cassini spacecraft. Rhea is 1.6 million kilometers (994,000 miles) from
the spacecraft. This view looks toward the trailing hemisphere of Janus (179
kilometers, or 111 miles across) and the Saturn-facing side of Rhea (1,528
kilometers, or 949 miles across).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 8, 2010. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel on
Janus and 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel on Rhea.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
