Nature is often more complex and wonderful than it first appears. For example,
although it looks like a simple hexagon, this feature surrounding Saturn's
north pole is really a manifestation of a meandering polar jet stream.
Scientists are still working to understand more about its origin and behavior.

For more on the hexagon, see
[PIA11682](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11682).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 33 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in red light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 24, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 605,000 miles (973,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 19
degrees. Image scale is 36 miles (58 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
