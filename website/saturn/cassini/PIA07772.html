Few sights in the solar system are more strikingly beautiful than softly hued
Saturn embraced by the shadows of its stately rings.

The gas planet's subtle northward gradation from gold to azure is a striking
visual effect that scientists don't fully understand. Current thinking says
that it may be related to seasonal influences, tied to the cold temperatures
in the northern (winter) hemisphere. Despite Cassini's revelations, Saturn
remains a world of mystery.

Currently, the rings' shadows shield the mid-northern latitudes from the
harshest of the sun's rays. As Saturn travels around the sun in its 29-year
orbit, the shadows will narrow and head southward, eventually blanketing the
opposite hemisphere.

Images taken with blue, green and red spectral filters were used to create
this color view, which approximates the scene as it would appear to the human
eye. The view was brightened to enhance detail visible in the rings and within
their shadows.

The images were obtained with the Cassini wide-angle camera from a distance of
approximately 999,000 kilometers (621,000 miles) from Saturn on May 4, 2005,
as the spacecraft cruised a few degrees above the ring plane. The image scale
is about 60 kilometers (37 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
