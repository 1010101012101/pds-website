The Cassini spacecraft watches Saturn's small moon Epimetheus orbiting beyond
the planet's rings.

See [PIA09813](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09813) and
[PIA06226](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06226) for closer views
of this moon. Epimetheus (70 miles, or 113 kilometers across) orbits beyond
the thin F ring near the bottom center of this view and is farther from the
spacecraft than the rings are here. This view looks toward the southern,
unilluminated side of the rings from about 1 degree below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Dec. 30, 2011. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.5 million miles (2.4 million kilometers) from Epimetheus. Image scale is 9
miles (14 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
