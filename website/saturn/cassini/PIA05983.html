**Caption:**

The Cassini-Huygens spacecraft returned this image of Saturn on
May 16, 2004, when its imaging science subsystem narrow-angle camera was
too close to fit the entire planet in its field-of-view. Cassini is still
about 20 million kilometers (12.4 million miles) away and only 36 days
from reaching Saturn. Cassini has two cameras, a wide angle and narrow
angle. This narrow angle image was made using a combination of three
filters (red, green, blue) and was taken at a range of 24.3 million
kilometers (15.1 million miles). The view is from 13 degrees below the
equator. Enceladus, one of Saturn's 31 known moons, appears near the
south pole at the bottom of the image.
