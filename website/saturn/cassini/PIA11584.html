The Cassini spacecraft snags a close-up view of the shadow cast onto Saturn's
A ring by the moon Epimetheus as the planet approached its August 2009
equinox.

Epimetheus (113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) is not pictured here. See
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) for an earlier,
wide-angle-camera view which showed a short shadow from Epimetheus.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 19 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on July 11, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
447,000 kilometers (278,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1
mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
