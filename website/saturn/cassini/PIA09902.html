The Cassini spacecraft captures a view showing two of Saturn's moons and their
gravitational effects on nearby rings.

At top, Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across at its widest point) streaks
through the Keeler Gap, with its ever-present edge waves. At center,
Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across at its widest point) pulls away
from a recent encounter with the F ring. A bright background star is visible
below the F ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 41
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 8, 2008. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (788,000 miles) from
Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 53 degrees.
Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
