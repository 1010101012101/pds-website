The A and F rings are alive with moving structures in this Cassini spacecraft
view. Graceful drapes of ring material created by Prometheus are seen sliding
by at left, while clumpy ringlets slip through the Encke Gap.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is all but invisible to the
right of the lowest streamer seen here.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 12 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 7, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers
(1.2 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 163 degrees. Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
