Our robotic emissary, flying high above Saturn, captured this view of an alien
copper-colored ring world. The overexposed planet has deliberately been
removed to show the unlit rings alone, seen from an elevation of 60 degrees,
the highest Cassini has yet attained.

The view is a mosaic of 27 images --nine separate sets of red, green and blue
images-- taken over the course of about 45 minutes, as Cassini scanned across
the entire main ring system.

The planet's shadow carves a dark swath across the ring plane at the right.
The overexposed planet has been removed.

Moons visible in this image: Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across)
at the 1 o'clock position, Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across) at the
5 o'clock position, Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) at the 10
o'clock position.

Bright clumps of material in the narrow F ring moved in their orbits between
each of the color exposures, creating a chromatic misalignment that provides
some sense of the continuous motion in the ring system.

Radially extending lens flare artifacts, which result from light being
scattered within the camera optics, are present in the view.

The images in this natural-color view were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 21, 2007, at a distance of approximately
1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 90
kilometers (56 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
