**Caption:**

Our robotic emissary, flying high above Saturn, captured this view of an 
alien copper-colored ring world. The overexposed planet has deliberately 
been removed to show the unlit rings alone, seen from an elevation of 60 
degrees, the highest Cassini has yet attained.

The view is a mosaic of 27 images --nine separate sets of red, green and 
blue images-- taken over the course of about 45 minutes, as Cassini 
scanned across the entire main ring system.

The planet's shadow carves a dark swath across the ring plane at the 
right. The overexposed planet has been removed.

Moons visible in this image: Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles 
across) at the 1 o'clock position, Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles 
across) at the 5 o'clock position, Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles 
across) at the 10 o'clock position.

Bright clumps of material in the narrow F ring moved in their orbits 
between each of the color exposures, creating a chromatic misalignment 
that provides some sense of the continuous motion in the ring system.

Radially extending lens flare artifacts, which result from light being 
scattered within the camera optics, are present in the view.

The images in this natural-color view were obtained with the Cassini 
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 21, 2007, at a distance of 
approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) from Saturn. Image 
scale is 90 kilometers (56 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
