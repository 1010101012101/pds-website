**Caption:**

Saturn's moon Pandora is almost overwhelmed by the brightness of the F 
ring in this view. The F ring's bright core displays kinks and is flanked 
by fainter ringlets. Imaging scientists recently determined these fainter 
ringlets to be a single spiral ring that winds around the planet. Pandora 
is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

Pandora is faintly lit by "Saturnshine," or reflected light from the 
planet, and few features can be seen here. This image was acquired by 
Cassini exactly three hours after the spacecraft took the image seen in 
[PIA07601](PIA07601.html), which showed Prometheus interior to the F ring.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Aug. 21, 2005, at a distance of approximately 
583,000 kilometers (362,000 miles) from Saturn and at a high 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 136 degrees. Resolution in the 
original image was 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel. 

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
