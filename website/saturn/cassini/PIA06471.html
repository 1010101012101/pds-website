**Caption:**

Lonely Mimas swings around Saturn, seeming to gaze down at the planet's 
splendid rings. The outermost, narrow F ring is visible here and exhibits 
some clumpy structure near the bottom of the frame. The shadow of Saturn's 
southern hemisphere stretches almost entirely across the rings. Mimas is 
398 kilometers (247 miles) wide.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on 
August 15, 2004, at a distance of 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million 
miles) from Saturn, through a filter sensitive to visible red light. The 
image scale is 53 kilometers (33 miles) per pixel. Contrast was slightly 
enhanced to aid visibility.
almost entirely across the rings. Mimas is 398 kilometers (247 miles) wide.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the 
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in 
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space 
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, 
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based 
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
