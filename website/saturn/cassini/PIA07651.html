Viewing Saturn's rings very close to edge-on produces some puzzling effects,
as these two images of the F ring demonstrate.

The upper image was acquired from less than a tenth of a degree beneath the
ringplane and shows a mysterious bulge. Such a feature has not been seen
previously by the Cassini spacecraft from this angle. It is possible that,
because of the very shallow viewing angle, the Cassini spacecraft's view takes
a long path through the ring, making very faint material visible. It also may
be that an embedded object of a kilometer or so in size stirs up the
neighboring ring particles to create a bulge. Alternatively, an impact into an
embedded moonlet that was covered with debris could produce a cloud like this.

Images taken by the Voyager spacecrafts showed clumps that might have been
produced in these ways. Cassini's investigations will help to determine the
vertical extent of such clumps and understand their origins.

The lower image was obtained from less than a hundredth of a degree beneath
the ringplane. Across the center of the rings is a dark lane, giving them an
appearance not unlike that of a spiral galaxy, seen edge-on.

Both images were taken using the clear spectral filters (predominantly visible
light) on the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera. The images have been
magnified by a factor of two. The top image was obtained at a distance of 3.6
million kilometers (2.2 million miles) from Saturn on Nov. 11, 2005 and shows
wispy fractures on Dione's trailing hemisphere. The image scale is 22
kilometers (14 miles) per pixel. The bottom image was acquired at a distance
of 2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn on Nov. 5, 2005. The
image scale is 15 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
