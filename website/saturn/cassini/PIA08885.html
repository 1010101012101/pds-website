**Caption:**

Three of the small worlds that hug the outer edges of Saturn's immense 
ring system are captured in this Cassini spacecraft portrait.

The two F ring shepherd moons, Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles 
across) and Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across) are seen flanking 
the ring at bottom. Janus (181 kilometers, or 113 miles across) is visible 
near the top of the scene.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Jan. 18, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.1 
million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale on the sky at 
the distance of Saturn is 61 kilometers (38 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
