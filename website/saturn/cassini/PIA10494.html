The Cassini spacecraft looks toward Rhea's cratered, icy landscape with the
dark line of Saturn's ringplane and the planet's murky atmosphere as a
background.

Rhea is Saturn's second-largest moon, at 1,528 kilometers (949 miles) across.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a
degree above the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July 17, 2007 at a distance of approximately
1.2 million kilometers (770,000 miles) from Rhea. Image scale is 7 kilometers
(5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
