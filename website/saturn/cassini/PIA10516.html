**Caption:**

In the Maxwell gap within Saturn's C ring resides a narrow, eccentric
ringlet of the same name. Astronomers are studying this ringlet to
understand how it is maintained.

One possibility is that a small moon or two lurk in the gap. Cassini plans
to search for any such moons.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 25, 2008 at a distance of approximately
876,000 kilometers (545,000 miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 36 degrees. Image scale is 5
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
