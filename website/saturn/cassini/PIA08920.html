Pan prepares to be engulfed by the darkness of Saturn's shadow, visible here
as it stretches across the rings.

When the Cassini spacecraft took a follow-up image of this same location about
50 seconds later, Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across) had vanished into
darkness.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 44
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 14, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers
(1.2 million miles) from Pan. Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
