**Caption:**

Pan prepares to be engulfed by the darkness of Saturn's shadow, visible
here as it stretches across the rings.

When the Cassini spacecraft took a follow-up image of this same location
about 50 seconds later, Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across) had
vanished into darkness.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 44
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on March 14, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.9
million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Pan. Image scale is 11
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
