Saturn's odd but ever-intriguing F ring displays multiple lanes and several
bright clumps. The Keeler and Encke gaps are visible in the outer A ring, at
right.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 28
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 5, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers
(1.3 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 12 kilometers (8 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
