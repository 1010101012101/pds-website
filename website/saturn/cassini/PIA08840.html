**Caption:**

This expansive view takes in most of Saturn's main ring system, from the 
outer C ring to the narrow and knotted-looking F ring. The broad 
brightness plateaus in the C ring (at bottom) transform into the more 
densely populated (and thus darker in this viewing geometry) B ring. The 
rings' appearance becomes brighter and smoother beyond the bands of the 
Cassini Division, in the A ring.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 49 degrees 
above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible blue light with the Cassini spacecraft 
wide-angle camera on Nov. 21, 2006 at a distance of approximately 539,000 
kilometers (335,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or 
phase, angle of 98 degrees. Image scale is 29 kilometers (18 miles) per 
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
