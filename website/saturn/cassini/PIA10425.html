**Caption:**

Tethys passes silently between Saturn and Cassini as a train of storms
rumbles through the planet's southern hemisphere. The rings' shadows
darken the planet at top.

Tethys is 1,062 kilometers (660 miles) across.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 2
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on June 4, 2008. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (756,000 miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 69 kilometers (43 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
