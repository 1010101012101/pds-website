**Caption:**

This dramatic image shows Saturn's craggy moon Pandora skimming along the 
F ring's outer edge. 

Pandora orbits about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) exterior to the ring, 
but in this view is projected onto the ring. The moderately 
high-resolution of the image reveals the moonlet's odd shape. Pandora is 
84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

The image was acquired from less than a degree below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on Oct. 29, 2005, at a distance of approximately 
455,000 kilometers (283,000 miles) from Pandora. The image scale is 3 
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
