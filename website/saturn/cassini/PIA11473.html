Saturn's northern hemisphere is seen here against its nested rings.

This view from the Cassini spacecraft looks toward the unilluminated side of
the rings from about 30 degrees above the ringplane. The rings have been
brightened relative to the planet to enhance visibility.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Feb. 24, 2009 at a distance of approximately
866,000 kilometers (538,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 38 kilometers
(24 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
