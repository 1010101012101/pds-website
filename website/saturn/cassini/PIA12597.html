Two moons orbit serenely before Saturn while large storms churn through the
planet's southern hemisphere.

The moon Mimas (396 kilometers, or 246 miles across) is on the right. Dione
(1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is on the left. This view looks toward
the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Nov. 23, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 77 degrees. Image scale is 73 kilometers
(45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
