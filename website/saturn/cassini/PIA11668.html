Vertical structures, among the tallest seen in Saturn's main rings, rise
abruptly from the edge of Saturn's B ring to cast long shadows on the ring in
this image taken by NASA's Cassini spacecraft two weeks before the planet's
August 2009 equinox.

Part of the Cassini Division, between the B and the A rings, appears at the
top of the image, showing ringlets in the inner division.

In this image, Cassini's narrow angle camera captured a 1,200-kilometer-long
(750-mile-long) section arcing along the outer edge of the B ring. Here,
vertical structures tower as high as 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) above the
plane of the rings -- a significant deviation from the vertical thickness of
the main A, B and C rings, which is generally only about 10 meters (about 30
feet).

Cassini scientists believe that this is one prominent region at the outer edge
of the B ring where large bodies, or moonlets, up to a kilometer or more in
size, are found. It is possible that these bodies significantly affect the
ring material streaming past them and force the particles upward, in a
"splashing" manner.

This image and others like it (see
[PIA11669](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11669)) are only
possible around the time of Saturn's equinox, which occurs every half-Saturn-
year, or about every 15 Earth years. The illumination geometry that
accompanies equinox lowers the sun's angle to the ring plane and causes
structures jutting out of the plane to cast long shadows across the rings. The
"season" of equinox allows shadows to appear on the rings in the months before
and after equinox, but the actual equinox occurred August 11, 2009, as the sun
shone directly edge-on to the ring plane.

This view looks toward the southern, sunlit side of the rings from about 32
degrees below the ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 26, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
336,000 kilometers (209,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 132 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
