**Caption:**

Prometheus pulls material from the tortured F ring in this highly detailed
view. The aftereffects of the moon's other recent encounters with the ring
are visible above as dark channels in the inner ringlet.

One of two F ring shepherd moons, Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles)
across.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about
seven degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on June 1, 2007 at a distance of approximately 2.1
million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 12
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
