The Cassini spacecraft looks across Saturn's rings and finds the moon
Prometheus, a shepherd of the thin F ring.

Prometheus (53 miles, or 86 kilometers across) looks like a small white bulge
near the F ring -- the outermost ring seen here -- above the center of the
image. See [PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397) and
[PIA07712](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07712) to learn how the
moon perturbs the F ring.

Kinky, discontinuous ringlets can also be seen in the Encke Gap of the A ring
on the left of the image. See
[PIA12650](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12650) to learn more.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 1 degree below the ringplane. Four background stars are visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 1, 2012. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.1 million miles (1.8 million kilometers) from Prometheus. Image scale is 7
miles (11 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
