Peering over the shoulder of giant Saturn, through its rings, and across
interplanetary space, NASA's Cassini spacecraft spies the bright, cloudy
terrestrial planet, Venus. The vast distance from Saturn means that Venus only
shows up as a white dot, just above and to the right of the image center.

Venus, along with Mercury, Earth, and Mars, is one of the rocky 'terrestrial'
planets in the solar system that orbit relatively close to the sun. Though
Venus has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide that reaches nearly 900 degrees
Fahrenheit (500 degrees Celsius) and a surface pressure 100 times that of
Earth, it is considered a twin to our planet because of their similar size,
mass, rocky composition and orbit. Venus is covered in thick sulfuric acid
clouds, making it very bright.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 17
degrees below the ring plane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Nov. 10, 2012.

This is a true-color picture of Saturn and Venus. A false-color mosaic
including an image very similar to this one can be seen at
[PIA14934](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA14934).

The bright arc is the limb of Saturn. A portion of the rings is seen in
silhouette against the face of Saturn, which itself is faintly illuminated by
sunlight scattered off the rings. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 498,000 miles (802,000 kilometers) from Saturn and at a sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 178 degrees. Image scale is 28 miles (44
kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
