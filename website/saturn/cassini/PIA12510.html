**Caption:**

Tiny Daphnis appears as a bright dot in the Keeler Gap next to shadows 
cast by the moon and the edge waves it has created in the A ring in this 
image taken before Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) can be seen casting a short 
shadow on the left of the image. The moon has an inclined orbit and its 
gravitational pull perturbs the orbits of the particles of the A ring 
forming the Keeler Gap's edge and sculpts the edge into waves having both 
horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components. Material on the inner 
edge of the gap orbits faster than the moon so that the waves there lead 
the moon in its orbit. Material on the outer edge moves slower than the 
moon, so waves there trail the moon. See [PIA11656](PIA11656.html) to learn more about 
this process. Both the moon and the edge waves can be seen casting shadows 
in this image.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's 
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes 
out-of-plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across 
the rings. These scenes are possible only during the few months before and 
after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. 
Before and after equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the 
predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see [PIA11657](PIA11657.html)), but also the 
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see 
[PIA11665](PIA11665.html)).

This view looks toward the southern, sunlit side of the rings from about 
20 degrees below the ringplane.

Three background stars are visible in this image.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft 
narrow-angle camera on May 10, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance 
of approximately 969,000 kilometers (602,000 miles) from Saturn and at a 
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 45 degrees. Image scale is 5 
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space 
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
