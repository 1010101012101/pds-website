Tiny Daphnis appears as a bright dot in the Keeler Gap next to shadows cast by
the moon and the edge waves it has created in the A ring in this image taken
before Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) can be seen casting a short shadow
on the left of the image. The moon has an inclined orbit and its gravitational
pull perturbs the orbits of the particles of the A ring forming the Keeler
Gap's edge and sculpts the edge into waves having both horizontal (radial) and
out-of-plane components. Material on the inner edge of the gap orbits faster
than the moon so that the waves there lead the moon in its orbit. Material on
the outer edge moves slower than the moon, so waves there trail the moon. See
[PIA11656](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11656) to learn more
about this process. Both the moon and the edge waves can be seen casting
shadows in this image.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the southern, sunlit side of the rings from about 20
degrees below the ringplane.

Three background stars are visible in this image.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 10, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
969,000 kilometers (602,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 45 degrees. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
