**Caption:**

The multitude of grooves for which Saturn's rings are famed, clumps in
the F ring, and three Saturnian moons are visible in this image. Moons
visible in the image are: Mimas (398 kilometers or 247 miles across)
above the rings at left; Epimetheus (116 kilometers or 72 miles across)
just above the A ring; Enceladus (499 kilometers or 310 miles across)
near upper right. The image was taken with the Cassini narrow angle
camera on May 10, 2004, at a distance of 27.1 million kilometers (16.8
million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 162 kilometers (101 miles) per
pixel. Contrast in the image was enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the
European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, manages the Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space
Science, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras,
were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based
at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
