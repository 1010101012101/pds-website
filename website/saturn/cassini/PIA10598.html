**Caption:**

The Cassini spacecraft peers through Saturn's delicate, translucent inner
C ring to see the diffuse blue limb of Saturn's atmosphere.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 20
degrees above the ringplane. Images taken using red, green and blue
spectral filters were combined to create this natural color view. The
images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on
April 25, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers
(930,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per
pixel. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space
Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.
