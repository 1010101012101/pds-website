Cassini scientists continue their quest to understand the origin and evolution
of the newly discovered features observed in Saturn's A ring which have become
known as "propellers." In this image, the propeller which scientists have
dubbed "Earhart" (at the lower left of the image) has been re-acquired.

Scientists hope to understand how the bodies which generate the features --
themselves too small to be seen, yet significantly larger than a typical ring
particle -- move around the ring over time. It is hoped that these features
may provide insights about how forming planets move around their solar
systems. For more on Earhart, see
[PIA12790](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12790).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 48 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 11, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 250,000 miles (400,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 99
degrees. Image scale is 1 mile (2 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
