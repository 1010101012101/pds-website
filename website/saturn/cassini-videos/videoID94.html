**Enceladus Animation**

This animation shows the Cassini spacecraft approaching Saturn's icy moon
Enceladus. It shows the highest resolution images obtained of the moon's
surface. This is followed by a depiction of Saturn's magnetic field, which
interacts with Enceladus' atmosphere and presumed plume coming from the south
pole.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
