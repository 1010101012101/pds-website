**3D Movie of Saturn's Rings During Ring Plane Crossing**

|  
---|---  
  
This 3D movie was made from a sequence of images taken by NASA's Cassini
spacecraft as it crossed the plane of Saturn's main rings. The main rings are
nearly as broad from edge to edge as the distance from the Earth to the moon
but are only a few tens of meters thick -- like a piece of paper the size of
Golden Gate Park. Scientists have struggled for centuries to measure their
thickness from Earth, without success. The ring particles are centimeters to
meters in size, and their gentle collisions keep the rings so strongly
flattened.

Note the dramatic change in the appearance of the rings as the ring plane is
crossed. Regions containing many particles are opaque (the B ring), so are
bright on the sunlit side and dark on the side facing away from the sun.
Regions containing only a few particles (the C ring and Cassini Division)
appear bright from both the lit and unlit sides.
