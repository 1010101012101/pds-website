**Unidentified F Ring Objects**

---|---  
  
A solitary clump-like feature in Saturn's F ring orbits past in this movie
sequence made from Cassini images. This feature is seen magnified at the
bottom right in [PIA07716](http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/image-
details.cfm?imageID=1700).

Scientists are trying to determine whether these features are solid moonlets
that help control the ring or just loose clumps of particles within the ring.

The images in this sequence were acquired in visible light using the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 13, 2005, at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is about 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
