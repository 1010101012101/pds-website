**Rounding the Corner**

A movie sequence of Saturn's G ring over a full orbital revolution captures
its single bright arc on the ring's inner edge.

The movie is composed of 70 individual narrow-angle camera images taken during
a period of just over 20 hours while Cassini stared at the ring. The orbital
period for particles in the center of the G ring is about 19.6 hours.

At the beginning of the sequence, the ring arc, a site of concentrated ring
particles, is seen rounding the ring edge.

The arc orbits at a distance of 167,496 kilometers (104,080 miles). It is
about 250 kilometers (155 miles) wide in radius and subtends less than 60
degrees of orbital longitude. The classical position of the G ring is about
172,600 kilometers (107,250 miles) from Saturn, and the arc blends smoothly
into this region. Scientists suspect that bodies trapped in this remarkably
bright feature may be the source of the G ring material, driven outward from
the arc by electromagnetic forces in the Saturn system.

The arc itself is likely held in place by gravitational resonances with Mimas
of the type that anchor the famed arcs in Neptune's rings. There is an obvious
narrow dark gap in the G ring beyond the arc. This feature is close to yet
another resonance with Mimas, but no arcs are present at this locale.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 10 degrees above
the ringplane. Imaging artifacts jitter within the scene, a result of the high
phase angle and faintness of the G ring. Stars slide across the background
from upper left to lower right.

The images in this movie were taken on Sept. 19 and 20 at a distance of
approximately 2.1 to 2.2 million kilometers (1.3 to 1.4 million miles) from
Saturn and at a Sun-G ring-spacecraft, or phase, angle that ranged from 167 to
164 degrees. Image scale is about 13 kilometers (8 miles) per pixel in the
radial (outward from Saturn) direction.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
