**Caption:**

This synthesized image shows very fine structure Saturn's F Ring, including a
dense outer core and a diffuse set of inner strands. Note that the uniformity
and lack of kinks or knots here are only artifacts of the
[occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiment, which takes a single
narrow slice of the rings.
