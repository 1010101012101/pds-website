**Caption:**

This synthesized images shows fine structure around the Encke Gap in Saturn's
outer A Ring. The regular stripes inward from the ring (right) are caused by
the gravitational [shepherding](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) of the tiny
embedded moon Pan. In fact, it was the analysis of this data set, combined
with others, that made it possible first to predict the existence of Pan and
then to detect it in the Voyager images. The fainter ringlet in the middle of
the gap (in red) probably consists of dust escaping off the surface of Pan and
stabilized by Pan's gravity. This image has a resolution of about 1 km.
