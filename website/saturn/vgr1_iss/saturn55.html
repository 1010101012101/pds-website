**Caption:**

This enhanced color image shows the outer half of Saturn's main ring system.
The dark Cassini Division near the middle divides the outer A Ring from the B
Ring. The Cassini Division was once thought to be empty, but this view shows
that it contains several fainter ring structures. The most prominent structure
in the A Ring is the Encke Gap, about 1/3 way from the ring's outer edge. This
gap is ["shepherded"](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite). open by the tiny
embedded moon Pan. The B Ring is more densely packed with material than the A
Ring (i.e., higher in [optical depth](/glossary.html#optical_depth)) so it
shows up as brighter in this image at a low [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle). Several faint "spokes" are visible as dark
streaks across the B Ring. Much better images of the B Ring's spokes were
acquired by Voyager 2 about nine months
later. At lower right, you can see the outer tip of the much fainter C Ring.
