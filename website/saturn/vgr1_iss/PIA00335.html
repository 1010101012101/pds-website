**Caption:**

Voyager 1 image of Saturn and its ring taken Nov. 16, 1980 four days
 after closest approach to Saturn, from a distance of 5,300, 000 km
 (3,300,000 miles). This viewing geometry, which shows Saturn as a
 crescent, is never achieved from Earth. The Saturnian rings, like the
 cloud tops of Saturn itself, are visible because they reflect
 sunlight.  The translucent nature of the rings is apparent where
 Saturn can be seen through parts of the rings. Other parts of the
 rings are so dense with orbiting ice particles that almost no sunlight
 shines through them and a shadow is cast onto the yellowish cloud tops
 of Saturn, which in turn, casts a shadow across the rings at
 right. The black strip within the rings is the Cassini Division, which
 contains much less orbiting ring material than elsewhere in the rings.
