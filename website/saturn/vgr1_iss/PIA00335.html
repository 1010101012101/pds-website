**Caption: **

Voyager 1 image of Saturn and its ring taken Nov. 16, 1980 four days after
closest approach to Saturn, from a distance of 5,300, 000 km (3,300,000
miles). This viewing geometry, which shows Saturn as a crescent, is never
achieved from Earth. The Saturnian rings, like the cloud tops of Saturn
itself, are visible because they reflect sunlight. The translucent nature of
the rings is apparent where Saturn can be seen through parts of the rings.
Other parts of the rings are so dense with orbiting ice particles that almost
no sunlight shines through them and a shadow is cast onto the yellowish cloud
tops of Saturn, which in turn, casts a shadow across the rings at right. The
black strip within the rings is the Cassini Division, which contains much less
orbiting ring material than elsewhere in the rings.
