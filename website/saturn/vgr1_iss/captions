The A and B Rings

The outer half of Saturn's main ring system showing dark Cassini Division.

This enhanced color image shows the outer half of Saturn's main ring
system.  The dark Cassini Division near the middle divides the outer
A Ring from the B Ring.  The Cassini Division was once thought to be 
empty, but this view shows that it contains several fainter ring 
structures.  The most prominent structure in the A Ring is the Encke 
Gap, about 1/3 way from the ring's outer edge.  This gap is
<A HREF="/glossary.html#shepherding_satellite">"shepherded"</A>.
open by the tiny embedded moon Pan. The B Ring is more densely packed
with material than the A Ring (i.e., higher in
<A HREF="/glossary.html#optical_depth">optical depth</A>)
so it shows up as brighter in this image at a low 
<A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A>.
Several faint "spokes" are visible as dark streaks across the B Ring.
Much better images of the B Ring's spokes were acquired by
<A HREF="/saturn/voyager/index2.html">Voyager 2</A>
about nine months later.  At lower right, you can see the outer tip of 
the much fainter C Ring.

Looking Back at Saturn's Rings

F Ring and a diffuse spoke can be seen in this image

This image, in enhanced color, was taken by Voyager 1 looking back at 
Saturn after the encounter, from about 1.5 million km.  At this high
<A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A>,
the dusty F Ring comes into view; it is the very narrow and somewhat
clumpy ringlet just outside the main rings.  A diffuse, spoke is seen
crossing the brightest part of the B Ring; in this lighting geometry the
spokes Ring appear bright rather than dark, suggesting that they are
made of fine dust.  The innermost C Ring is darker than the others due
both to darker particles and fewer of them; its characteristic banded
appearance is quite different from the A and B Rings, but similar to the
structure in the Cassini Division (the dark area between the A and B
Rings. The C Ring's brightness increases toward the left due to
increased illumination from Saturn's lit face.

The Rings in Forward-Scattered Light

F Ring and spokes get bright as phase angle increases.

As the
<A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A>
increases, the dusty F Ring and the spokes get brighter and brighter.

The Dark Side of the A and B Rings

Contrast of the rings is reversed when you look at their unlit face.

The contrast of the rings reverses when you look at their unlit face.
Very little light manages to scatter through the dense and
<A HREF="/glossary.html#optical_depth">optically thick</A>
B Ring (at right), so it appears much darker than the others.  The
Cassini Division is brightest of all, because light has an easy time
scattering through this faint cloud of material. False color has been
used in this image to enhance subtle variations in the color (and
therefore the composition) of the ring material.

The Dark Side of the B and C Rings

Sunlight scatters easily through the optically thin C Ring.

This image is very similar to the one above, but the point of view is 
shifted inward to show the B and C Rings.  The C Ring is
<A HREF="/glossary#optical_depth">optically thin</A>
so sunlight scatters through it easily, making it brighter than the B 
Ring in this lighting geometry. Viewing the ring's unlit face, something
can appear dark for one of two reasons, either because it is nearly
opaque (like the B Ring at left) or because it is almost completely
transparent (like the region inside the C Ring at right).  In the former
case there is too much material for light to leak through, whereas in
the latter case there is no material to scatter the light. Enhanced
false color has been used to show subtle color variations in the rings.

Optical Depth of the Rings

Can you see Saturn?  Some rings are opaque, some are transparent.

This Voyager image shows the rings passing in front of the planet.  As a
result, you can see which rings are opaque 
<A HREF="/glossary.html#optical_depth">(optically thick)</A>
and which are transparent (optically thin).  Part of the middle B Ring
obscures the planet completely, while the planet easily shines through
the fainter, inner C Ring.

Closeup of the "Braided" F Ring

Bends, kinks and bright clumps in ring give the illusion of being braided.

This closeup view of Saturn's F Ring is from Voyager 1 image
<A HREF="/glossary.html#fds">FDS</A> 34930.48.
It shows that the ring is composed of two
bright strands and a fainter one inside them.  The bright rings contain
bends, kinks and bright clumps that give the illusion that these strands
are braided.  These features may be caused by the small gravitational
effects of the nearby

Pandora and Prometheus.  The grid of black dots in the image are

Rings and Mimas

Striking image of dark side of the rings with Mimas behind.

This striking image was taken looking across the dark side of Saturn's
rings, with Mimas in the background.  The narrow F Ring is visible
outside the A and B Rings.
