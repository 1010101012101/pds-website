**Caption: **

This Voyager image shows the rings passing in front of the planet. As a
result, you can see which rings are opaque [(optically
thick)](/glossary.html#optical_depth) and which are transparent (optically
thin). Part of the middle B Ring obscures the planet completely, while the
planet easily shines through the fainter, inner C Ring.
