**Caption:**

The crescent of Saturn, the planet's rings and their shadows are seen
 in this Voyager 1 image taken Nov. 13, 1980 at a distance of 1,500,000
 kilometers (930,000 miles) as the spacecraft began to leave the Saturn
 system. The bright limb of Saturn is clearly visible through the A, B,
 and C rings. The dark band cutting through the crescent is the shadow
 of the rings. This image was overexposed to bring out detail in the
 rings, so the crescent appears artificially brighter. The Voyager
 Project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
 Calif.
