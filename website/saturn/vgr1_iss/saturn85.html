**Caption:**

This image is very similar to the one above, but the point of view is shifted
inward to show the B and C Rings. The C Ring is [optically
thin](/glossary.html#optical_depth) so sunlight scatters through it easily,
making it brighter than the B Ring in this lighting geometry. Viewing the
ring's unlit face, something can appear dark for one of two reasons, either
because it is nearly opaque (like the B Ring at left) or because it is almost
completely transparent (like the region inside the C Ring at right). In the
former case there is too much material for light to leak through, whereas in
the latter case there is no material to scatter the light. Enhanced false
color has been used to show subtle color variations in the rings.
