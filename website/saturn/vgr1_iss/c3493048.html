**Caption:**

This closeup view of Saturn's F Ring is from Voyager 1 image
[FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 34930.48. It shows that the ring is composed of two
bright strands and a fainter one inside them. The bright rings contain bends,
kinks and bright clumps that give the illusion that these strands are braided.
These features may be caused by the small gravitational effects of the nearby
[shepherding moons](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) Pandora and Prometheus.
The grid of black dots in the image are [reseau](/glossary.html#reseau)
markings.
