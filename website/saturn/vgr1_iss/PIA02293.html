**Caption:**

This narrow-angle camera image of Saturn's F Ring was taken through the
 Clear filter while at a distance of 6.9 million km from Saturn on 8
 November 1980. The brightness variations of this tightly-constrained
 ring shown here indicate that the ring is less uniform in makeup than
 the larger rings. JPL managed the Voyager Project for NASA's Office of
 Space Science
