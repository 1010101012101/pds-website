**Caption:**

When seen from the unlit side, the rings of Saturn present a much
 different appearance from that familiar to telescopic observers.
 Relatively opaque areas like the B Ring turn black, while lightly
 populated zones, such as the C Ring and the Cassini Division, prove to
 to excellent diffuse transmitters of sunlight. The A Ring, whith
 intermediate opacity, is at an intermediate level of brightness.
