**Caption:**

Both the limb of Saturn and the shadow of its ring system are seen
 through the transparent C ring in this striking picture taken by
 NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 9, 1980 at a distance of 4.5 million
 kilometers (3 million miles).  Gaps and regions of high transparency
 are seen throughout the C ring, especially in the area closest to the
 opaque B ring.  Shadows of the A, B, and C rings are clearly visible
 on the disk of Saturn.  The C ring shadow showing the gaps described
 above is the uppermost shadow; below this is the very black shadow of
 the opaque B ring, then the Cassini Division, and at the bottom, the
 shadow of the A ring.
