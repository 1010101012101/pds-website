Voyager 1 looked back at Saturn on Nov. 16, 1980, four days after the
spacecraft flew past the planet, to observe the appearance of Saturn and its
rings from this unique perspective. A few of the spokelike ring features
discovered by Voyager appear in the rings as bright patches in this image,
taken at a distance of 5.3 million kilometers (3.3 million miles) from the
planet. Saturn's shadow falls upon the rings, and the bright Saturn crescent
is seen through all but the densest portion of the rings. From Saturn, Voyager
1 is on a trajectory taking the spacecraft out of the ecliptic plane, away
from the Sun and eventually out of the solar system (by about 1990). Although
its mission to Jupiter and Saturn is nearly over (the Saturn encounter ends
Dec. 18, 1980), Voyager 1 will be tracked by the Deep Space Network as far as
possible in an effort to determine where the influence of the Sun ends and
interstellar space begins. Voyager 1's flight path through interstellar space
is in the direction of the constellation Ophiuchus. Voyager 2 will reach
Saturn on August 25, 1981, and is targeted to encounter Uranus in 1986 and
possibly Neptune in 1989. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California.
