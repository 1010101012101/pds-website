**Caption:**

This narrow-angle camera image of Saturn's B Ring and Cassini Division
 was taken through the Clear filter from a distance of 12.6 million km
 on 3 November 1980. The Cassini Division separating the A and B Rings
 is clearly not an empty region. The Division shows several substantial
 well-defined ringlets. JPL managed the Voyager Project for NASA's
 Office of Space Science.
