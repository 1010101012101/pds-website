**Caption:**

This computer-assembled two-image mosaic of Saturn's rings, taken by
 NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov. 6, 1980 at a range of 8 million kilometers (5
 million miles), shows approximately 95 individual concentric features
 in the rings. The extraordinarily complex structure of the rings is
 easily seen across the entire span of the ring system. The ring
 structure, once thought to be produced by the gravitational interaction
 between Saturn's satellites and the orbit of ring particles, has now
 been found to be too complex for this explanation alone. The 14th
 satellite of Saturn, discovered by Voyager 1, is seen (upper left) just
 inside the narrow F Ring, which is less than 150 kilometers (93 miles
 wide). The Voyager Project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
