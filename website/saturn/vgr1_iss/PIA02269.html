**Caption: **

Eight hours after its closest approach to Saturn on Nov. 12, 1980, Voyager 1
took this picture of the planet's ring system. Major features of the rings are
clearly seen: from the top of the image down is the bright F Ring, the A Ring,
the Cassini Division, the broad B Ring, and the C Ring (dark gray area). The
spacecraft took this picture at a distance of 720,000 kilometers (446,000
miles) from an angle approximately 30 degrees above the ring plane. The unique
lighting in this view brings out the many hundreds of bright and dark ringlets
that make up this very thin, phonograph record-like ring system. The dark
spokelike features seen in images taken during approach to Saturn now appear
as bright streaks, indicating that they possess a strong forward- scattering
property. The Voyager Project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
