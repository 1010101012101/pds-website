**Caption:**

The contrast of the rings reverses when you look at their unlit face. Very
little light manages to scatter through the dense and [optically
thick](/glossary.html#optical_depth) B Ring (at right), so it appears much
darker than the others. The Cassini Division is brightest of all, because
light has an easy time scattering through this faint cloud of material. False
color has been used in this image to enhance subtle variations in the color
(and therefore the composition) of the ring material.
