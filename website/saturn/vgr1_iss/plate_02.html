**Caption:**

This image, in enhanced color, was taken by Voyager 1 looking back at Saturn
after the encounter, from about 1.5 million km. At this high [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle), the dusty F Ring comes into view; it is
the very narrow and somewhat clumpy ringlet just outside the main rings. A
diffuse, spoke is seen crossing the brightest part of the B Ring; in this
lighting geometry the spokes Ring appear bright rather than dark, suggesting
that they are made of fine dust. The innermost C Ring is darker than the
others due both to darker particles and fewer of them; its characteristic
banded appearance is quite different from the A and B Rings, but similar to
the structure in the Cassini Division (the dark area between the A and B
Rings. The C Ring's brightness increases toward the left due to increased
illumination from Saturn's lit face.
