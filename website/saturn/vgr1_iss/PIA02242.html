**Caption:**

This detailed mosaic of the underside of the Cassini Division was
 obtained by Voyager 1 with a resolution of about 10 kilometers. The
 classical Cassini Division appears here to the right of center as five
 bright rings with substantial blacks gap on either side. The inner edge
 of the A Ring, to the left of center, is the brightest part of this
 image. The fine-scale wave structure in this region has been
 interpreted as being the result of gravitational density waves.
