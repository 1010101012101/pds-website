# Saturn's Ring System

The rings of Saturn have puzzled astronomers ever since they were discovered
by Galileo in 1610, during the first telescopic observations of the night sky.
The puzzles have only increased since Voyagers 1 and 2 imaged the ring system
extensively in 1980 and 1981. In addition to the images, several Voyager
instruments observed occultations of the ring system with radial resolution as
fine as 100 meters. The rings have been given letter names in the order of
their discovery. The main rings are, working outward from the planet, known as
C, B, and A. The Cassini Division is the largest gap in the rings and
separates Rings B and A. In addition a number of fainter rings have been
discovered more recently. The D Ring is exceedingly faint and closest to the
planet. The F Ring is a narrow feature just outside the A Ring. Beyond that
are two far fainter rings named G and E. The particles in Saturn's rings are
composed primarily of water ice and range from microns to meters in size. The
rings show a tremendous amount of structure on all scales; some of this
structure is related to gravitational perturbations by Saturn's many moons,
but much of it remains unexplained.

## _Animations_

  * **Voyager Animations**

    * [ The Voyager 2 flyby of Saturn](/saturn/animations/saturn_fly-by.qt) (Quicktime format, 822 Kbytes) 

This animation illustrates the geometry of Voyager 2's passage through the
Saturn system. This was a NASA full motion video clip, converted to QuickTime
format.

    * [A "spoke" movie](/saturn/animations/saturn_spoke.mov) (Quicktime format, 1.02 Mbytes) 

A sequence of Voyager images was used to generate this movie showing the
motion of the mysterious "spokes" in Saturn's B Ring.

    * [ A stellar occulation by Saturn's rings](/saturn/animations/saturn_pps_v.mov) (Quicktime format, 1.02 Mbytes) 

The Voyager 2 [ photopolarimeter (PPS)](/voyager/pps/) and [ ultraviolet
spectrometer (UVS)](/voyager/uvs/) instruments observed the occultation of the
star delta Sco by Saturn's rings. These experiments resolved the rings down to
a scale of 100 meters. This animation shows the viewing geometry during the
experiment.
