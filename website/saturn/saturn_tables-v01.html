# Vital Statistics for Saturn's Rings and Inner Satellites

### Rings of Saturn

Feature | Boundaries (km) | Optical Depth | Notes  
---|---|---|---  
| Inner | Outer |  |  
D Ring | 66,900 | 74,658 | 10^-5 | Contains narrow ringlets at 67,580 and
71,710 km.  
C Ring | 74,658 | 91,975 | 0.05 to 0.35 | Isolated "plateaus" among a
surrounding, fainter ring.  
Titan Ringlet | 77,871 | 77,896 |  | A narrow, eccentric ringlet inside a gap
in the C Ring.  
Maxwell Ringlet | 87,491 | 87,555 |  | A narrow, eccentric ringlet inside a
gap in the C Ring.  
1.470 Rs Ringlet | 88,716 | 88,732 |  | A narrow, eccentric ringlet inside a
gap in the C Ring.  
1.495 Rs Ringlet | 90,171 | 90,232 |  | A narrow, eccentric ringlet inside a
gap in the C Ring.  
B Ring | 91,975 | 117,507 | 0.4 to 2.5 | Contains fine structure on all
scales. The most opaque of Saturn's rings.  
Cassini Division | 117,507 | 122,340 | 0 to 0.1 | The prominent gap between
the A and B Rings. It contains several features of low optical depth.  
Huygens Ringlet | 117,825 | 118,185 |  | A narrow, eccentric ringlet near the
inner edge of the Cassini Division.  
A Ring | 122,340 | 136,780 | 0.4 to 1.0 | A fairly uniform ring with many
density and bending waves near its outer edge.  
Encke Gap | 133,410 | 133,740 | 0 | A gap in the A Ring "shepherded" open by
the embedded moon Pan. One or more faint ringlets are also present.  
Keeler Gap | 136,510 | 136,550 | 0 | An empty gap near the outer edge of the A
Ring.  
F Ring (core) | 140,219 | 0.1 to 1 | An eccentric ringlet containing clumps
and kinks. Based on its eccentricity, its radial limits are 140,194 to 140,244
km.  
G Ring | 166,000 | 173,200 | 10^-6 | A very faint, isolated dust ring.  
E Ring | 180,000 | 480,000 | 10^-6 | A broad, faint dust ring encompassing the
orbits of Mimas through Dione. Densest near the orbit of Enceladus. Up to ~
30,000 km thick.
