**Caption:**

This artist's rendering shows "Dynamic Ephemeral Bodies" (DEB's) in Saturn's
rings viewed from just above the plane. In this particular dynamical model of
the rings, house-sized bodies (the largest shown here) grow in a matter of
days by accretion of much smaller particles. However, the large bodies
continually break up due to tidal forces, as in the case of the S-shaped
disaggregating swarm in the right foreground. Large bodies are irregularly
shaped and lie roughly in a flat layer; smaller particles are scattered about
them. This painting by W. K. Hartmann represents a thinly populated locale in
the rings.
