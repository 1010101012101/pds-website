Pandora and the "Braided" F Ring

Artist's view of Saturn's rings seen from the surface of Pandora.

This artist's rendering simulates Saturn's rings as seen from the
surface of Pandora, one of the 
<A HREF="http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#shepherd_satellites">shepherds</A>
of the F Ring.  The clumpy, wispy F Ring crosses the image from top to
bottom, and the F Ring's other shepherd can be seen interior to the F
Ring near the top.  (Courtesy of Dave Seal, JPL).

Computer Model of the Ring Particle Size Distribution

Picture constructed based on Voyager Radio Science occultation data.

A computer-simulated view of particles ranging in size from marbles to
beach balls, populating a 3-meter-square section of Saturn's A Ring.
This picture was constructed to illustrate the size distribution of ring
particles based on Voyager Radio Science occultation data.  In reality
the particles are not smooth spheres, but their depiction here as
spheres is representative of the properties often assumed (implicitly or
explicitly) in mathematical models of the rings.

Dynamic Ephemeral Bodies

Accretion of smaller particles, and disaggregation due to tidal forces.

This artist's rendering shows "Dynamic Ephemeral Bodies" (DEB's) in
Saturn's rings viewed from just above the plane.  In this particular
dynamical model of the rings, house-sized bodies (the largest shown
here) grow in a matter of days by accretion of much smaller particles. 
However, the large bodies continually break up due to tidal forces, as
in the case of the S-shaped disaggregating swarm in the right
foreground.  Large bodies are irregularly shaped and lie roughly in a
flat layer; smaller particles are scattered about them.  This painting
by W. K. Hartmann represents a thinly populated locale in the rings.
