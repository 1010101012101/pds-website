**Caption:**

A computer-simulated view of particles ranging in size from marbles to beach
balls, populating a 3-meter-square section of Saturn's A Ring. This picture
was constructed to illustrate the size distribution of ring particles based on
Voyager Radio Science [occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) data. In
reality the particles are not smooth spheres, but their depiction here as
spheres is representative of the properties often assumed (implicitly or
explicitly) in mathematical models of the rings.
