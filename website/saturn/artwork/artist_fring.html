**Caption: **

This artist's rendering simulates Saturn's rings as seen from the surface of
Pandora, one of the [shepherds](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellites) of the F
Ring. The clumpy, wispy F Ring crosses the image from top to bottom, and the F
Ring's other shepherd can be seen interior to the F Ring near the top.
