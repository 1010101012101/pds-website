Saturn's magnificent ring system is seen tilted edge- on -- for the second
time this year -- in this NASA Hubble Space Telescope picture taken on August
10, 1995, when the planet was 895 million miles (1,440 million kilometers)
away. Hubble snapped the image as Earth sped back across Saturn's ring plane
to the sunlit side of the rings. Last May 22, Earth dipped below the ring
plane, giving observers a brief look at the backlit side of the rings. Ring-
plane crossing events occur approximately every 15 years. Earthbound observers
won't have as good a view until the year 2038. Several of Saturn's icy moons
are visible as tiny starlike objects in or near the ring plane. They are from
left to right, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione and Mimas. "The Hubble data shows
numerous faint satellites close to the bright rings, but it will take a couple
of months to precisely identify them," according to Steve Larson (University
of Arizona). During the May ring plane crossing, Hubble detected two, and
possibly four, new moons orbiting Saturn. These new observations also provide
a better view of the faint E ring, "to help determine the size of particles
and whether they will pose a collision hazard to the Cassini spacecraft," said
Larson. The picture was taken with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 in
wide field mode. This image is a composite view, where a long exposure of the
faint rings has been combined with a shorter exposure of Saturn's disk to
bring out more detail. When viewed edge-on, the rings are so dim they almost
disappear because they are very thin -- probably less than a mile thick.

The Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 was developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and managed by the Goddard Spaced Flight Center for NASA's Office
of Space Science.
