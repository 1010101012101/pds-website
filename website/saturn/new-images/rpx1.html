TOP - This is a NASA Hubble Space Telescope snapshot of Saturn with its rings
barely visible. Normally, astronomers see Saturn with its rings tilted. Earth
was almost in the plane of Saturn's rings, thus the rings appear edge-on.

In this view, Saturn's largest moon, Titan, is casting a shadow on Saturn.
Titan's atmosphere is a dark brown haze. The other moons appear white because
of their bright, icy surfaces. Four moons - from left to right, Mimas, Tethys,
Janus, and Enceladus - are clustered around the edge of Saturn's rings on the
right. Two other moons appear in front of the ring plane. Prometheus is on the
right edge; Pandora, on the left. The rings also are casting a shadow on
Saturn because the Sun was above the ring plane.

BOTTOM - This photograph shows Saturn with its rings slightly tilted. The moon
called Dione, on the lower right, is casting a long, thin shadow across the
whole ring system due to the setting Sun on the ring plane. The moon on the
upper left of Saturn is Tethys.

Astronomers also are studying the unusual appearance of Saturn's rings. The
bottom image displays a faint, narrow ring, the F-ring just outside the main
ring, which normally is invisible from Earth. Close to the edge of Saturn's
disk, the front section of rings seem brighter and more yellow than the back
due to the additional lumination by yellowish Saturn.

The color images were assembled from separate exposures taken August 6 (top)
and November 17 (bottom), 1995 with the Wide Field Planetary Camera-2.

The Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 was developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and managed by the Goddard Spaced Flight Center for NASA's Office
of Space Science.
