**Caption: **      Original Caption Released with Image:

This was one of the first pictures obtained once Voyager 2 resumed returning
images Aug. 29 after its scan platform was commanded to view Saturn. Problems
with the platform, on which Voyager's cameras and other instruments are
mounted, had prevented the return of images for a few days. This view shows
some detail and differences in the complex system of rings. The "reddening" of
the B-ring on the unlit side also was seen in Voyager 1 images. Voyager 2
obtained this picture from a range 3.4 million kilometers (2.1 million miles)
through the clear, green and violet filters.

The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif.
