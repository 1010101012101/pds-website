Possible variations in chemical composition from one part of Saturn's ring
system to another are visible in this Voyager 2 picture as subtle color
variations that can be recorded with special computer-processing techniques.
This highly enhanced color view was assembled from clear, orange and
ultraviolet frames obtained Aug. 17 from a distance of 8.9 million kilometers
(5.5 million miles). In addition to the previously known blue color of the
C-ring and the Cassini Division, the picture shows additional color
differences between the inner B-ring and outer region (where the spokes form)
and between these and the A-ring.

The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif.
