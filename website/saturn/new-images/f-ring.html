**Caption: **      Original Caption Released with Image:

Voyager 2 obtained this picture of Saturn's F-ring on Aug. 26 just before the
spacecraft crossed the planet's ring plane. This edge-on view, taken from a
range of 103,000 kilometers (64,000 miles), shows nearly 25` of the F-ring,
with at least four distinct components visible. Voyager's photopolarimeter
conducted a higher-resolution scan through another part of the ring, showing
it to be composed of even more distinct ringlets than this frame would
indicate.

The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif.
