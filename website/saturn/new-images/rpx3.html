In one of nature's most dramatic examples of 'now-you see-them, now-you-
don't', NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured Saturn on May 22, 1995 as the
planet's magnificent ring system turned edge-on. This ring-plane crossing
occurs approximately every 15 years when the Earth passes through Saturn's
ring plane.

For comparison, the top picture was taken by Hubble on December 1, 1994 and
shows the rings in a more familiar configuration for Earth observers.

The bottom picture was taken shortly before the ring plane crossing. The rings
do not disappear completely because the edge of the rings reflects sunlight.
The dark band across the middle of Saturn is the shadow of the rings cast on
the planet (the Sun is almost 3 degrees above the ring plane.) The bright
stripe directly above the ring shadow is caused by sunlight reflected off the
rings onto Saturn's atmosphere. Two of Saturn's icy moons are visible as tiny
starlike objects in or near the ring plane. They are, from left to right,
Tethys (slightly above the ring plane) and Dione.

This observation will be used to determine the time of ring-plane crossing and
the thickness of the main rings and to search for as yet undiscovered
satellites. Knowledge of the exact time of ring-plane crossing will lead to an
improved determination of the rate at which Saturn 'wobbles' about its axis
(polar precession).

Both pictures were taken with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2. The top
image was taken in visible light. Saturn's disk appears different in the
bottom image because a narrowband filter (which only lets through light that
is not absorbed by methane gas in Saturn's atmosphere) was used to reduce the
bright glare of the planet. Though Saturn is approximately 900 million miles
away, Hubble can see details as small as 450 miles across.

The Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 was developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and managed by the Goddard Spaced Flight Center for NASA's Office
of Space Science.
