Full size image](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/new-images/wide-
angle.jpg)** **Caption: **      Original Caption Released with Image:

This wide-angle image of Saturn's rings was taken Aug. 26 just before Voyager
2's crossing of the plane of these complex structures. The spacecraft was
103,000 kilometers (64,000 miles) from the rings when it acquired this image.
This extremely oblique view of the bright side of the rings highly magnifies
features near the bottom of the picture and compresses features across to the
other side of the west ansa (the western edge of the loop in the rings).
Starting from the bottom, one can see the F-ring, the A-ring with the Encke
Gap, the Cassini Division (the narrow dark band at center), the B-ring and the
C-ring. The high-contrast bright and dark areas of the C-ring are seen at
right; then, continuing upward, come the B- and A-rings straddling the Cassini
Division and a very foreshortened view of the A-ring. The bright streaks in
the B-ring are the spokes in forward-scattered light. The Voyager project is
managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
