Even from afar, Cassini's cameras reveal a tremendous amount of detail in the
planet's rings. The punctuated detail in the C ring, the bright fine structure
in the B ring, the dark bands within the Cassini Division, the bland nature of
the outermost A ring, as well as knots in the twisted F ring, are all visible.
The moon Tethys (1,060 kilometers, or 659 miles, across) hovers beyond the
rings at the top.

This image was taken from beneath the ring plane in visible green light with
the Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera on Nov. 1, 2004, at a distance of
approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. The
image scale is 129 kilometers (80 miles) per pixel. This image has been
slightly contrast-enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
