The usually bright B ring (at center) appears very dim in this view of the
rings taken on the side of the rings that is not illuminated. The scene
resembles a photographic negative, with bright and dark areas reversed
(although in some places in the rings, the blackness of space is seen.) From
this viewing angle, the rings are lit from below: both dense and empty regions
are dark, and regions of intermediate particle density are bright.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera on Oct. 27,
2004, at a distance of about 631,000 kilometers (392,000 miles) from Saturn
through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of visible violet light. The image
scale is 34 kilometers (21 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
