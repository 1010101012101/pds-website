The high northern latitudes on Enceladus show little detail from Cassini's
distant vantage point, nearly 50 degrees above the moon's equator.

The plume of icy material that jets from the south pole of Enceladus (505
kilometers, or 314 miles across) is not visible in this viewing geometry.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 26, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 95 degrees. Scale in the original image was 10 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel. The image was contrast enhanced and magnified by a factor of
two.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
