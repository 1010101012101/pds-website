This wide and sweeping view of the sunlit rings of Saturn takes in the
impressive variety in their structure -- from the clumpy and perennially
intriguing F ring to the many waves, ringlets and gaps in the A and B rings
and the Cassini Division in between.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 9, 2006 at a distance of approximately 640,000 kilometers
(397,000 miles) from Saturn. The view was acquired from about 10 degrees below
the ringplane. Image scale on the sky at the distance of Saturn is 35
kilometers (22 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
