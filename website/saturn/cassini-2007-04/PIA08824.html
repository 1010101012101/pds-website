Several spiral density waves in Saturn's A ring are seen in this detailed
view. There is a grainy texture visible between the brightness peaks in the
most prominent wave. Scientists think the graininess might be indicative of
self-gravitating clumps of material that are formed by the spiraling wave.

Downward in the image represents the direction toward Saturn. This view looks
toward the lit side of the rings from about 42 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Nov. 8, 2006\. Cassini was then at a distance of approximately
300,000 kilometers (200,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 27 degrees. Image scale is 1 kilometer (4,580 feet) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
