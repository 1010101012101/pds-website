Bright strands in Saturn's ever changing F ring emerge from the planet's
shadow. The F ring usually has a single bright core, about 50 kilometers (31
miles) across, but the section of the ring seen here appears to have a second
bright strand.

Several background stars are visible by the trails they created while the
image was being exposed.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 59 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 9, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
