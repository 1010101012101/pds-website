Cassini took a series of images on Sept. 9, 2006 as it watched the bright red
giant star Aldebaran slip behind Saturn's rings. This type of observation is
known as a stellar occultation and uses a star whose brightness is well known.
As Cassini watches the rings pass in front, the star's light fluctuates,
providing information about the concentrations of ring particles within the
various radial features in the rings.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the outer A ring (just interior to
the Encke Gap) from about 19 degrees below the ringplane. Bright Aldebaran is
over exposed, creating thin vertical lines on its image.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 9, 2006 at a distance of approximately 358,000 kilometers
(223,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale on the sky at the distance of Saturn
is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
