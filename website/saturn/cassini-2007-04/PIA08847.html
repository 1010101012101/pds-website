Prometheus interacts gravitationally with the inner flanking ringlets of the F
ring, creating dark channels as it passes.

This image was taken in a complete azimuthal scan of the rings, during which
Cassini followed Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) around the
rings for one complete orbit, or about 14 hours.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 41 degrees above
the ringplane. The moon is partly lit by sunlight (at left) and elsewhere lit
by reflected light from Saturn.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 23, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers
(900,000 miles) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 152 degrees. Image scale is 9 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
