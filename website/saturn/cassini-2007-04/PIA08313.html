The spoke-producing region of the B ring displays fine-scale asymmetry in the
azimuthal direction -- the direction along which the ring particles orbit
Saturn -- from upper left to lower right across the image.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 14 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 12, 2006 at a distance of approximately 429,000 kilometers
(267,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
