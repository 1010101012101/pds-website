This magnificent view looks down upon, and partially through, Saturn's rings
from their unlit side.

The densest part of the rings occults the bright globe of Saturn. Scientists
can use observations like this to determine precisely the concentration of
ring particles.

When the bright source is the signals coming from the spacecraft, the
technique is called a 'radio occultation.' In a radio occultation measurement,
a signal is beamed toward Earth from Cassini's 4-meter-wide (13-foot) high-
gain antenna. Researchers on Earth receive the signal as the spacecraft passes
behind the rings. The reduction in Cassini's radio signal tells researchers
how densely packed the ring particles are. Scientists can also learn about the
size distributions of the particles from occultations.

As an added (but tiny) bonus, Saturn's moon Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles
across) is visible as a dark speck against the planet, just outside the A
ring.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Aug. 2, 2005, at a distance of approximately 617,000
kilometers (383,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 37 kilometers (23
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
