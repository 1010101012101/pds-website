The rings of Saturn glow softly as sunlight from below wends its way through.
Some of the Sun's light bounces off the rings' opposite side and can be seen
illuminating Saturn's night side southern hemisphere.

Such a view is only possible from the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 33
degrees above the ringplane. Shadows of the innermost rings are cast upon the
planet at upper left. The edge of Saturn's shadow cuts a straight line across
the rings near upper right.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on March 30, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.9 million kilometers
(1.2 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 117 kilometers (73 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
