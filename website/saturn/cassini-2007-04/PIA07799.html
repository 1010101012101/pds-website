As Saturn's active moon Enceladus continues to spew icy particles into space,
scientists struggle to understand the mechanics of what is going on beneath
the fractured south polar terrain. This graphic illustrates key aspects of the
model proposed by the Cassini imaging science team in a paper published in the
journal Science on March 10, 2006.

The model shows how proposed underground reservoirs of pressurized liquid
water above 273 degrees Kelvin (0 degrees Celsius) could fuel geysers that
send jets of icy material into the skies above the moon's south pole. In the
graphic, the vent to the surface pierces one of the "tiger stripe" fractures
seen in Cassini views of the southern polar terrain (see
[PIA06247](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06247) for a look at
the tiger stripes). Temperatures increase with depth.

Some combination of internal radioactive decay and flexing -- perhaps
concentrated within the tiger stripe fractures and brought about by the
particular characteristics of Enceladus' orbit--is implicated as the source of
the heat creating the liquid reservoirs. However, it is not yet clear how the
deep interior of Enceladus functions, nor whether the moon is fully
differentiated (separated into layers, with rock at the center and ice
outside).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
