Saturn's moon Dione is about to swing around the edge of the thin F ring in
this color view. More than one thin strand of the F ring's tight spiral can be
seen here.

The terrain seen on Dione is on the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere. The
diameter of Dione is 1,126 kilometers (700 miles).

Images taken using infrared, green and ultraviolet spectral filters were
composited to create this color view. The images were taken with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 20, 2005, at a distance of
approximately 2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Dione and at a
Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 48 degrees. The image scale is 12
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
