Bright ringlets and dark gaps at the inner edge of the C ring sweep across
this scene. The C ring contains numerous "plateaus" -- broad ring regions that
are bright and surrounded by fainter material.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 23, 2006. The view was captured from 14 degrees below the ring
plane and at a distance of approximately 272,000 kilometers (169,000 miles)
from Saturn. Image scale is 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
