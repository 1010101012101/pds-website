A montage of Cassini images, taken in four different regions of the spectrum
from ultraviolet to near-infrared, demonstrates that there is more to Saturn
than meets the eye.

The pictures show the effects of absorption and scattering of light at
different wavelengths by both atmospheric gas and clouds of differing heights
and thicknesses. They also show absorption of light by colored particles mixed
with white ammonia clouds in the planet's atmosphere. Contrast has been
enhanced to aid visibility of the atmosphere.

Cassini's narrow-angle camera took these four images over a period of 20
minutes on April 3, 2004, when the spacecraft was 44.5 million kilometers
(27.7 million miles) from the planet. The image scale is approximately 267
kilometers (166 miles) per pixel. All four images show the same face of
Saturn.

In the upper left image, Saturn is seen in ultraviolet wavelengths (298
nanometers); at upper right, in visible blue wavelengths (440 nanometers); at
lower left, in far red wavelengths just beyond the visible-light spectrum (727
nanometers; and at lower right, in near-infrared wavelengths (930 nanometers).

The sliver of light seen in the northern hemisphere appears bright in the
ultraviolet and blue (top images) and is nearly invisible at longer
wavelengths (bottom images). The clouds in this part of the northern
hemisphere are deep, and sunlight is illuminating only the cloud-free upper
atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths are consequently scattered by the gas and
make the illuminated atmosphere bright, while the longer wavelengths are
absorbed by methane.

Saturn's rings also appear noticeably different from image to image, whose
exposure times range from two to 46 seconds. The rings appear dark in the
46-second ultraviolet image because they inherently reflect little light at
these wavelengths. The differences at other wavelengths are mostly due to the
differences in exposure times.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
