Saturn's southern atmosphere looms before Cassini, displaying rich detail in
its swirls and bands. The bright, icy moon Enceladus (499 kilometers, or 310
miles across) appears near the bottom of the image.

This view was taken through a filter where methane gas is a moderate absorber
of sunlight. Since methane gas is not present on Enceladus, its surface
scatters a higher percentage of the light falling on it than Saturn does,
making the moon appear very bright compared with the planet. Enceladus was
dimmed in brightness by a factor of four during processing of the image, in
order to make its brightness comparable to that of Saturn.

The rings show some fine structure here. The three main rings, C, B and A from
innermost to outermost, are clearly defined by their differences in
brightness.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on Sept.
19, 2004, at a distance of 8.3 million kilometers (5.2 million miles) from
Saturn through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
727 nanometers. The image scale is 49 kilometers (30 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
