In a splendid portrait created by light and gravity, Saturn's lonely moon
Mimas is seen against the cool, blue-streaked backdrop of Saturn's northern
hemisphere. Delicate shadows cast by the rings arc gracefully across the
planet, fading into darkness on Saturn's night side.

The part of the atmosphere seen here appears darker and more bluish than the
warm brown and gold hues seen in Cassini images of the southern hemisphere,
due to preferential scattering of blue wavelengths by the cloud-free upper
atmosphere.

The bright blue swath near Mimas (398 kilometers, or 247 miles across) is
created by sunlight passing through the Cassini division (4,800 kilometers, or
2,980 miles wide). The rightmost part of this distinctive feature is slightly
overexposed and therefore bright white in this image. Shadows of several thin
ringlets within the division can be seen here as well. The dark band that
stretches across the center of the image is the shadow of Saturn's B ring, the
densest of the main rings. Part of the actual Cassini division appears at the
bottom, along with the A ring and the narrow, outer F ring. The A ring is
transparent enough that, from this viewing angle, the atmosphere and
threadlike shadows cast by the inner C ring are visible through it.

Images taken with red, green and blue filters were combined to create this
color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on Nov. 7, 2004, at a distance of 3.7 million kilometers (2.3 million
miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 22 kilometers (14 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
