This view, like [PIA08303](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08303),
shows Prometheus with a streamer it has created in the inner edge of the F
ring. Prometheus comes close to the inner edge of the ring once per orbit,
perturbing the ring particles there. In 2009, the moon's orbit is expected to
carry it repeatedly into the F ring core, an event that ring scientists are
eagerly awaiting.

Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across. This view looks toward the
unlit side of the rings from about 40 degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 16, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.8 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 150 degrees. Scale in the original image was 11 kilometers (7
miles) per pixel. The image has been magnified by a factor of two.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
