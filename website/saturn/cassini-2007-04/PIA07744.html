Speeding toward pale, icy Dione, Cassini's view is enriched by the tranquil
gold and blue hues of Saturn in the distance. The horizontal stripes near the
bottom of the image are Saturn's rings. The spacecraft was nearly in the plane
of the rings when the images were taken, thinning them by perspective and
masking their awesome scale. The thin, curving shadows of the C ring and part
of the B ring adorn the northern latitudes visible here, a reminder of the
rings' grandeur.

It is notable that Dione, like most of the other icy Saturnian satellites,
looks no different in natural color than in monochrome images.

Images taken on Oct. 11, 2005, with blue, green and infrared (centered at 752
nanometers) spectral filters were used to create this color view, which
approximates the scene as it would appear to the human eye. The images were
obtained with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera at a distance of
approximately 39,000 kilometers (24,200 miles) from Dione and at a Sun-Dione-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 22 degrees. The image scale is about 2
kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
