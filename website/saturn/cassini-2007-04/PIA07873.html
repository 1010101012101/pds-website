Specially designed Cassini orbits place Earth and Cassini on opposite sides of
Saturn's rings, a geometry known as occultation. Cassini conducted the first
radio occultation observation of Saturn's rings on May 3, 2005.

Three simultaneous radio signals of 0.94, 3.6, and 13 centimeter wavelength
(Ka-, X-, and S-bands) were sent from Cassini through the rings to Earth. The
observed change of each signal as Cassini moved behind the rings provided a
profile of the distribution of ring material as a function of distance from
Saturn, or an optical depth profile.

This simulated image was constructed from the measured optical depth profiles.
It depicts the observed ring structure at about 10 kilometers (6 miles) in
resolution. Color is used to represent information about ring particle sizes
in different regions based on the measured effects of the three radio signals.

Purple color indicates regions where there is a lack of particles of size less
than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches). Green and blue shades indicate regions
where there are particles smaller than 5 centimeters (2 inches) and 1
centimeter (less than one third of one inch). The saturated broad white band
near the middle of ring B is the densest region of ring B, over which two of
the three radio signals were blocked at 10-kilometer (6-mile) resolution,
preventing accurate color representation over this band. From other evidence
in the radio observations, all ring regions appear to be populated by a broad
range particle size distribution that extends to boulder sizes (several to
many meters across).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radio science team
is based at JPL.
