A cold, dusky Saturn looms in the distance in this striking, natural color
view of the ringed planet and five of its icy satellites. This image was
composed from exposures taken by Cassini's narrow angle camera on Nov. 9,
2003, from a distance of 111.4 million kilometers (69.2 million miles). That
is about three-fourths the distance of Earth from the Sun and 235 days from
reaching Saturn. The smallest features visible here are about 668 kilometers
(415 miles) across - a marked improvement over the last Cassini Saturn image
released on Nov. 1, 2002. New features such as intricate cloud patterns and
small moons near the rings should become visible over the next several months
as the spacecraft speeds toward its destination.

Some details within Saturn's massive ring system are already visible.
Structure is evident in the B ring, the middle and brightest of Saturn's three
main rings. The 4,800 kilometer (2,980 mile)-wide Cassini Division is the
distinctive dark, central band that separates the outermost A ring from the
brighter B ring. Interestingly, the outer edge of the B ring is maintained by
a strong gravitational resonance with the moon Mimas, also visible in this
image. The 325-kilometer (200 -mile) wide Encke gap in the A ring, near the
outer edge of the ring system, is also visible, as is the fainter C ring,
interior to the B ring.

Saturn's multi-banded, multi-hued atmosphere is also apparent at this
distance. In the southern polar region, a dusky haze is visible, grayer than
the light-brown at middle latitudes. Most of Saturn's northern hemisphere is
in shadow of the rings, with the exception of a small sliver visible on the
limb. Five Saturnian satellites can also be seen in this image. The brightness
of these bodies has been increased three- to five-fold to enhance visibility.
The satellites are, on the left, from brightest to faintest, Rhea, Dione, and
Enceladus, and on the right, from brightest to faintest, Tethys and Mimas.

Cassini will enter Saturn orbit on July 1, 2004. For more information, see the
Cassini Project home page at <http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov> and the Cassini
imaging team home page, <http://ciclops.org>. The imaging team is based at the
Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
