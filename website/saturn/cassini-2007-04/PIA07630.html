The moons Dione and Tethys face each other across the gulf of Saturn's rings.
Here, the Cassini spacecraft looks on the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Tethys
below and the anti-Saturn side of Dione above. The dark groove in the rings is
the Cassini Division.

Tethys is 1,071 kilometers (665 miles) across, while Dione is 1,126 kilometers
(700 miles) across.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 22, 2005, at a distance of approximately 860,000 kilometers
(530,000 miles) from Dione. Tethys was on the far side of the rings, 1.5
million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Cassini. The image scale is 5
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel on Dione and 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel
on Tethys.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
