Saturn and its rings completely fill the field of view of Cassini's narrow
angle camera in this natural color image taken on March 27, 2004. This is the
last single 'eyeful' of Saturn and its rings achievable with the narrow angle
camera on approach to the planet. From now until orbit insertion, Saturn and
its rings will be larger than the field of view of the narrow angle camera.

Color variations between atmospheric bands and features in the southern
hemisphere of Saturn, as well as subtle color differences across the planet's
middle B ring, are now more distinct than ever. Color variations generally
imply different compositions. The nature and causes of any compositional
differences in both the atmosphere and the rings are major questions to be
investigated by Cassini scientists as the mission progresses.

The bright blue sliver of light in the northern hemisphere is sunlight passing
through the Cassini Division in Saturn's rings and being scattered by the
cloud-free upper atmosphere.

Two faint dark spots are visible in the southern hemisphere. These spots are
close to the latitude where Cassini saw [two storms
merging](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05386) in mid-March. The
fate of the storms visible here is unclear. They are getting close and will
eventually merge or squeeze past each other. Further analysis of such dynamic
systems in Saturn's atmosphere will help scientists understand their origins
and complex interactions.

Moons visible in this image are (clockwise from top right): Enceladus (499
kilometers or 310 miles across), Mimas (398 kilometers or 247 miles across),
Tethys (1060 kilometers or 659 miles across) and Epimetheus (116 kilometers or
72 miles across). Epimetheus is dim and appears just above the left edge of
the rings. Brightnesses have been exaggerated to aid visibility.

The image is a composite of three exposures, in red, green and blue, taken
when the spacecraft was 47.7 million kilometers (29.7 million miles) from the
planet. The image scale is 286 kilometers (178 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
