Temperature changes mapped with Cassini's composite and infrared spectrometer
throughout Saturn's main rings show the ring temperatures decreasing with the
increase of the Sun-spacecraft-ring angle (called phase angle) on both the lit
and unlit sides of the rings. These temperature changes indicate that the ring
particles spin slowly compared to their orbital periods of 6 to 14 hours. They
may spin several times per orbit to less than one time per orbit.

Four scans are shown for the lit and unlit rings, at relatively low (less than
60 degrees) and high (more than 130 degrees) phase angles. Warmer temperatures
about minus 262 degrees Fahrenheit (110 Kelvin) are shown in red and cooler
temperatures about minus 343 degrees (65 K) are shown in blue. Other colors
indicate temperatures between minus 343 degrees and minus 262 degrees (65 K
and 110 K). The top two scans are for the lit rings and the bottom two scans
are for the unlit rings. The change in ring temperature between each scan can
be seen clearly.

The thermal characteristics of each main ring vary noticeably with phase
angle. Radial scans of the A, B and C rings show a decrease in temperature
with increasing phase angle for both the lit and unlit sides of the rings.

The C ring and Cassini Division exhibit the largest change in temperature. The
temperature of the lit C ring decreases by about 22 degrees (12 Kelvin)
between low and high phase angles. A similar contrast is present for the unlit
side of the C ring. The C ring and Cassini Division are darker than the A and
B rings so they can absorb more heat from the Sun. The lit B ring shows a
temperature contrast of approximately 18 degrees (10 K) while the unlit B ring
shows very little thermal contrast. Very little sunlight may make it through
the thick B ring to its unlit side. The lit A ring is particularly interesting
because the magnitude of the thermal contrast decreases with increasing radial
distance from Saturn. The outer A ring shows only a small temperature change
with phase angle, possibly because it contains smaller, or more rapidly
rotating ring particles, which would have more uniform temperatures with phase
angle.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The composite infrared
spectrometer team is based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt,
Md.
