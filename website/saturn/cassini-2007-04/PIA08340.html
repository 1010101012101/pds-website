With its dazzling rings, Saturn radiates a beauty and splendor like no other
known world. Here, Cassini has captured the cool crescent of Saturn from above
the ringplane, with the planet's shadow cutting neatly across the many lanes
of ice.

Saturn's southern hemisphere is lit on the night side by reflected light from
the rings. The rings cast shadows onto the northern daylit hemisphere at the
left, and can be seen in silhouette against the faintly illuminated `dark
side' of the planet at the right.

Light reflected inside the camera has left a generally streak-like pattern
across the raw images used for this color composite. This pattern appears as
multicolor fringes in the final product, but is greatly minimized because of
the image processing techniques.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were taken with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 31, 2006, at a distance of approximately
2.6 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 163 degrees. Image scale is 153 kilometers (95
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
