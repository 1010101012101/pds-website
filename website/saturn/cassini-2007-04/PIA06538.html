This majestic view of Saturn captures several phenomena of interest to
scientists working on the Cassini mission. The planet's nighttime atmosphere
looms ahead -- an excellent place to search for storms and lightning. Saturn's
shadow stretches across the rings, which will over the next four years receive
their most thorough examination since Galileo discovered them in 1610. And
barely visible near lower right just inside the F ring, is the small shepherd
moon Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across). Researchers will explore
the many moons of Saturn, including special ones like Prometheus that help
maintain some of the rings and gaps in this complex and dynamic system.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide angle
camera on Oct. 29, 2004, at a distance of about 940,000 kilometers (584,000
miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 52 kilometers (33 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
