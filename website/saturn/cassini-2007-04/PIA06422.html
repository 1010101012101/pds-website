Saturn and its rings are prominently shown in this color image, along with
three of Saturn's smaller moons. From left to right, they are Prometheus,
Pandora and Janus.

Prometheus and Pandora are often called the "F ring shepherds" as they control
and interact with Saturn's interesting F ring, seen between them.

This image was taken on June 18, 2004, with the Cassini spacecraft narrow
angle camera 8.2 million kilometers (5.1 million miles) from Saturn. It was
created using the red, green, and blue filters. Contrast has been enhanced to
aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington,
D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed
and assembled at JPL.
