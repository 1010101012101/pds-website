Sunlight reflects off the bright, frozen surfaces of the billions and billions
of particles comprising Saturn's rings to brighten the planet's southern
skies.

The particles in Saturn's rings are each too small to be seen by Cassini in
this image. If they could, each would look like the bright reflective crescent
of Enceladus (505 kilometers, 314 miles across) seen here, with each
reflecting sunlight onto the southern hemisphere of the planet.

The image was taken in polarized infrared light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on Nov. 2, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.7 million
kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 119 degrees. The image scale is 104 kilometers (65 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
