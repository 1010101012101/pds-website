The presence of the tiny ring moon Daphnis is betrayed by the edge waves it
creates in the Keeler gap.

The gap is a narrow lane, about 42 kilometers (26 miles) wide, in Saturn's
outer A ring. Daphnis (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across) was discovered in
Cassini spacecraft images at the same time that scientists spotted the edge
waves. Researchers had suspected the presence of a moon in this gap after Pan
was discovered in Voyager spacecraft images taken 25 years earlier.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 54
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 17, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.8 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
