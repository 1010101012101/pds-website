# Saturn's Ring System: Voyager-Era Animations

* [The Voyager 2 flyby of Saturn](saturn_flyby.mov)

This animation illustrates the geometry of Voyager 2's passage through the
Saturn system. This was a NASA full motion video clip, converted to QuickTime
format.

* [A "spoke" movie](saturn_spokes.mov)

A sequence of Voyager images was used to generate this movie showing the
motion of the mysterious "spokes" in Saturn's B Ring.

* [A stellar occulation by Saturn's rings](saturn_pps.mov)

The Voyager 2 [Photopolarimeter (PPS)](/voyager/pps/index.html)
and [Ultraviolet Spectrometer (UVS)](/voyager/uvs/index.html)
instruments observed the occultation of the star delta Sco by Saturn's rings.
These experiments resolved the rings down to a scale of 100 meters. This
animation shows the viewing geometry during the experiment.
