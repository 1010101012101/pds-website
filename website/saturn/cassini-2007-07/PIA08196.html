Cassini's "eyes" -- its powerful imaging cameras -- bear witness to the
majestic and spectacular sights of the Saturn system, as this views attests.
Here, the probe gazes upon Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200 miles across) in
the distance beyond Saturn and its dark and graceful rings.

This view was taken from above the ringplane and looks toward the unlit side
of the rings.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 938 nanometers. The image was obtained using the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 10, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn and 4.1
million kilometers (2.6 million miles) from Titan. The image was taken at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 149 degrees. Image scale is 17
kilometers (11 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
