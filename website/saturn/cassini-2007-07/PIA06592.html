Saturn's moon Telesto is visible below and to the left of center in this image
from the Cassini spacecraft.

Telesto (24 kilometers, or 15 miles across) shares the orbit of Saturn's moon
Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across), leading the larger moon in its
path by 60 degrees. Similarly sized Calypso (22 kilometers, or 14 miles
across) trails Tethys by the same amount. These positions, called Lagrange
points, are dynamically stable. In being co-orbital moons of Tethys, Telesto
and Calypso are like the Trojan moons of Jupiter, which occupy Lagrange points
and orbit 60 degrees ahead and behind of Jupiter. The Saturnian moon Dione
also has companion moons: Helene, which leads Dione in its orbit, and the
Cassini-discovered trailing Lagrange moon, Polydeuces.

North on Saturn is to the upper left in this view. The image was taken at a
Sun-Telesto-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 90 degrees. Telesto is seen here at
a phase similar to that of a first-quarter moon, where only half of the
visible hemisphere is illuminated by sunlight.

The planet's night side is at the upper right. The rings stretch across the
top of the image and are overexposed in this view.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on Jan. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 3.7 million kilometers
(2.3 million miles) from Telesto. Resolution in the image is 7 kilometers (4
miles) per pixel. Telesto has been brightened by a factor of two to aid
visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
