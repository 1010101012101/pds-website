Mimas, seen here beyond Saturn's rings, is a major sculptor of Saturn's rings.
The 398-kilometer-wide (247-mile-wide) moon not only maintains the Cassini
Division (not seen here), a gap wide enough to be visible from Earth through a
small telescope, but it is also responsible for two of the thin, bright bands
visible in this image near the rings' center, interior to the dark Encke Gap.

Knots in the thin, twisted F ring also are easily visible here.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on Sept. 7, 2004, at a distance of 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million
miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 84
degrees. The image scale is 53 kilometers (33 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
