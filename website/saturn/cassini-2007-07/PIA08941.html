Across the expanse of Saturn's rings, the Cassini spacecraft spies two small
moons in consort.

Atlas (32 kilometers, or 20 miles across) is seen exterior to the bright outer
edge of the A ring. Daphnis (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across), below Atlas
in this view, orbits Saturn within the narrow Keeler Gap. The presence of
Daphnis is revealed by the waves it raises in the ring material surrounding it
on the edges of the gap. Daphnis and its waves moved between exposures taken
to create this color view, resulting in their slight displacement in each
color.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18
degrees above the ringplane. Bright clumps are visible in the narrow F ring.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 13, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from Atlas. Image
scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
