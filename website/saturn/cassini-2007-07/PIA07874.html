Cassini instruments provide complementary information about the structure of
Saturn's rings. Narrow and wide angle cameras provide images in the visible
region of the electromagnetic, spectrum much like a digital camera does. The
images have information about how the ring structure differs both with
distance from the planet and with position around the equatorial circle.
However, resolution is usually limited to few kilometers at best.

Radio and stellar occultations of the rings also provide important information
about ring structure, but only along a one-dimensional track through the
rings. The radial resolution can be as fine as 50 meters (164 feet). An
"image" is then constructed by assuming circular symmetry over the ring region
of interest. Color is usually added to encode other information related to the
observed structure.

This image compares structure of Saturn's rings observed by these two
approaches. The upper half is a natural color mosaic of images by the Cassini
narrow-angle camera (see
[PIA06175](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06175)). The bottom
simulated images is constructed from a radio occultation observation conducted
on May 3, 2005. Color in the lower image is used to represent information
about ring particle sizes. For another view created using this process (see
[PIA07872](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07872)).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The radio science team
is based at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
