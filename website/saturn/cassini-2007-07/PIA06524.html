Tiny Mimas is dwarfed by a huge white storm and dark waves on the edge of a
cloud band in Saturn's atmosphere.

Although the east-west winds on Saturn are stronger than on Earth or even
Jupiter, the contrast in appearance between these zones is more muted, and the
departures of the wind speeds from east to west are lower.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on Sept.
25, 2004, at a distance of 7.8 million kilometers (4.8 million miles) from
Saturn through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
727 nanometers. The image scale is 46 kilometers (29 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington,
D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed
and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
