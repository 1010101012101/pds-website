**Original Caption Released with Image: **     

This detailed view of Saturn's southern hemisphere shows clouds, storms and
waves in the planet's many latitudinal bands.

The image was taken through a filter where methane gas has strong absorption.
The cloud particles scatter light back toward the camera, but methane gas
absorbs it, so only high clouds are visible in this image. Differences in
cloud height are not resolvable; the impression of parallel ridges and troughs
is an optical illusion brought about by the alternating light and dark bands.

Saturn's rings were overexposed in this long duration exposure and appear
quite bright.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on Sept.
12, 2004, at a distance of 8.7 million kilometers (5.4 million miles) from
Saturn through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
889 nanometers. The image scale is 103 kilometers (64 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
