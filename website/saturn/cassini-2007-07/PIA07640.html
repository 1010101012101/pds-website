The Sun's rays strike the terrains near the terminator on Tethys at low
angles, throwing features there into sharp relief. The cluster of peaks at the
center of the crater Odysseus (450 kilometers, or 280 miles across) is
particularly bold. Melanthius crater is seen here at bottom.

This view shows the anti-Saturn hemisphere on Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665
miles across). North is up and rotated 20 degrees to the left. Saturn's rings
cut across the upper left portion of the scene.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 13, 2005 at a distance of approximately 646,000 kilometers
(401,000 miles) from Tethys and at a Sun-Tethys-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
109 degrees. The image scale is 4 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
