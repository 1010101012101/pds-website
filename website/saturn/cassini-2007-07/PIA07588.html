The latitude bands and swirling storms of Saturn, always intriguing to
scientists, often are exquisitely beautiful as well. The turbulent atmosphere
is dotted with storms; most are small, but some are much larger. The dark
center of the dramatic beauty swirling near the south pole is easily 2,000
kilometers (1,250 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on July 31, 2005, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of polarized
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers at a distance of approximately 1.4
million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 78
kilometers (48 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
