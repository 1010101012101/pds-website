Lonely Mimas swings around Saturn, seeming to gaze down at the planet's
splendid rings. The outermost, narrow F ring is visible here and exhibits some
clumpy structure near the bottom of the frame. The shadow of Saturn's southern
hemisphere stretches almost entirely across the rings. Mimas is 398 kilometers
(247 miles) wide.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on August
15, 2004, at a distance of 8.8 million kilometers (5.5 million miles) from
Saturn, through a filter sensitive to visible red light. The image scale is 53
kilometers (33 miles) per pixel. Contrast was slightly enhanced to aid
visibility. almost entirely across the rings. Mimas is 398 kilometers (247
miles) wide.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
