Prometheus dips into the inner F ring at its farthest point from Saturn in its
orbit, creating a dark gore and a corresponding bright streamer. Gores created
during previous apoapsis (the name for the farthest point in an orbit) passes,
are seen above. The older gores are farther behind the moon in its orbit of
Saturn.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 31 degrees above
the ringplane. Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 1, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 162 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
