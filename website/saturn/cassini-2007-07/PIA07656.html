An oval-shaped feature, wider than Earth and with streamers extending out to
the east and west, swirls in Saturn's southern hemisphere. Like the rainbands
of a Southern Hemisphere hurricane on Earth, the streamers spiral into the
feature in a clockwise direction. Unlike Earth's hurricanes, this storm
probably contains no liquid water.

The planet's equatorial rings cut across the top of the image.

The image was taken in wavelengths of polarized infrared light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 30, 2005, at a distance of
approximately 324,000 kilometers (202,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale
is 32 kilometers (20 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
