Crescent Saturn is girded by its dark belt of ice in this marvelous portrait
of the planet and the "dark" side of its rings. This is the unlit side of the
rings, where sunlight filters feebly through the lanes of particles.

This view is a mosaic of two images. No data were taken to fill in the missing
block in the upper left quadrant, and the inner part of the rings is cut off
there.

This view was acquired from about 4 degrees above the ringplane.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera using a
spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 727
nanometers on Nov. 6, 2006. Cassini was then at a distance of approximately
1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 148 degrees. Image scale is 77 kilometers (48
miles) per pixel.
