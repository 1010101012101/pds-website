The Cassini spacecraft's current high-inclination orbit allows for some
fantastic perspectives, like this shot of Saturn's south pole, which looks
toward the rings beyond.

The dark bullseye at the pole marks the eye of a great hurricane-like storm
investigated by Cassini in 2006. (See
[PIA08332](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08332) Looking Saturn
in the Eye.)

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera using a
spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 728
nanometers. The view was acquired on Dec. 13, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 790,000 kilometers (491,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is
44 kilometers (27 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
