The sharp outer boundary of Saturn's B ring, which is the bright ring region
seen to the right in this image, is maintained by a strong resonance with the
moon Mimas. For every two orbits made by particles at this distance from
Saturn, Mimas makes one orbit. The moon's repeated gravitational tugs force
ring particles away from this region.

The dark region is called the Huygens gap and it includes the bright,
eccentric Huygens ringlet, also visible here near center.

See [PIA06535](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06535) for a wide-
field view of this region.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 23, 2006. The view was obtained from 15 degrees beneath the
ringplane and at a distance of approximately 282,000 kilometers (175,000
miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
