Cassini takes in a wide-angle view of majestic, golden-hued Saturn ... home to
our robotic spacecraft for two years now. The ringplane cuts across the center
of Saturn's crescent which wears shadows cast by the icy rings.

The planet's now familiar blue and pink hues generally are more subtle in
high-phase views from the Cassini wide-angle camera. "Phase" refers to the
angle formed between the Sun, the planet and the spacecraft.

The view is a composite of two sets of color images taken using red, green and
blue spectral filters. The images were combined to create a color view that
approximates the scene as it might appear to human eyes.

The images were taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on May 24,
2006 at a distance of approximately 1.3 million kilometers (824,000 miles)
from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 139 degrees.
Image scale is 76 kilometers (47 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
