The "opposition effect" can be seen in this image of Saturn's B ring. The
bright spot occurs where the angle between the spacecraft, the Sun and the
rings is near zero. Studies of the opposition effect on Saturn's rings may
help scientists constrain some of the properties of ring particles, such as
their sizes and spatial distribution.

Another recently released image from Cassini also shows this interesting
effect of viewing geometry (see
[PIA07543](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07543)).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on June 26, 2005, at a distance of approximately 478,000 kilometers
(297,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
