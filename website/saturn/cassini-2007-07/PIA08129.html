This contrast-enhanced view of Saturn's faint G ring shows its extremely sharp
inner edge and more diffuse outer boundary. Using its large high-gain antenna
as a shield, the Cassini spacecraft flew through the region interior to the G
ring during insertion into Saturn orbit. The spacecraft was struck many times
by the fine icy particles that populate the region between the F and G rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 19, 2006, at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers
(700,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
