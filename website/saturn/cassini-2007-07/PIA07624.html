In this view, Saturn's moon Mimas is a mere pinprick of light, while the
nearly edge-on rings and the ghostly globe of Saturn steal the scene. Some of
the light reflected from the rings bounces onto Saturn and faintly illuminates
the planet's southern hemisphere. The strongly lit part of Saturn in the lower
right is lit by direct sunlight. Northward of the equator, the planet is
largely invisible.

Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Sept. 11, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3 million
kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is about 140
kilometers (87 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
