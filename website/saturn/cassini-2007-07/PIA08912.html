This Cassini spacecraft view shows details of Saturn's outer A ring, including
the Encke and Keeler gaps. The A ring brightens substantially outside the
Keeler Gap.

On both sides of the broad Encke gap are bright spiral density waves. See
[PIA08824](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08824) for comparison.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 52 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera using a
spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 930
nanometers. The view was acquired on Feb. 19, 2007 at a distance of
approximately 950,000 kilometers (590,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 5
kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
