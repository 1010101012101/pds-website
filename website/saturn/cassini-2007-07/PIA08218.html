Cassini captured this arresting view of Saturn just before Epimetheus crossed
into the blinding glare of the planet's sunlit crescent and was lost.

As it orbits Saturn, Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across) hugs the
outside edge of the narrow F ring, beyond the orbit of Pandora. The F ring is
the brightest ring feature seen here. Saturn's southern hemisphere is softly
lit by sunlight reflected off the rings.

A less obvious feature in this view is the planet's shadow, which begins to
darken the inner regions of the rings at left.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 9, 2006 at a distance of approximately 4 million kilometers
(2.5 million miles) from Epimetheus and 4.1 million kilometers (2.5 million
miles) from Saturn. The Sun-Epimetheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle is 161
degrees. Image scale is 25 kilometers (16 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
