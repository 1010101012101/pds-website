The rings are awash in subtle tones of gold and cream in this view which shows
the outer B ring, the Cassini Division and the inner part of the A ring.

In this viewing geometry, the brightest feature in the Cassini Division is the
recently discovered diffuse ringlet near the outer edge of the Division (see
also [PIA08330](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08330)). The
diffuse ringlet has a distinctive bluish cast.

The color of the rings appears more golden than earlier in the mission because
of the viewing geometry here -- increased scattering in the rings is brought
about by the high phase angle and the view being toward the rings' unlit side.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 30 degrees above
the ringplane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were acquired by the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Sept. 29, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 1.829 million kilometers (1.137 million miles) from Saturn.
Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
