Feathery cloud bands fill Saturn's graceful crescent. Features in the
atmosphere are visible all the way to the terminator, the boundary between
night and day, where the Sun's rays are coming in almost horizontally.

Because it is possible to see down to the same level, regardless of how high
the Sun is above the horizon, this indicates that the atmosphere above the
clouds is relatively clear.

The dark line across the top of the image is the nearly edge-on ringplane.

The image was taken in infrared light (centered at 728 nanometers) with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Oct. 31, 2005, at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 131 degrees. Image scale is 69
kilometers (43 miles) per pixel. The image was contrast enhanced to improve
visibility of features in the atmosphere.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
