Cassini peers through the icy particles that comprise Saturn's rings as
Prometheus sits perched on the planet's limb (edge). The rings cast shadows on
the planet, with darker regions corresponding to places where the ring
material is denser. The narrow dense regions are created by gravitational
resonances with moons, like Prometheus, that orbit near the rings. Prometheus
is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across.

The thin, bright core of the F ring can be seen against the planet and above
Prometheus.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 3, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers
(1.3 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
