This false-color image of Saturn's main rings was made by combining data from
multiple star occultations using the Cassini ultraviolet imaging spectrograph.

During occultations, scientists observe the brightness of a star as the rings
pass in front of the star. This provides a measurement of the amount of ring
material between the spacecraft and the star.

Cassini has given scientists the most detailed view yet of Saturn's densely
packed B ring. Cassini found that this part of the rings is densely packed
with clumps, called self-gravity wakes, separated by nearly empty gaps. These
clumps in Saturn's B ring are neatly organized and constantly colliding, which
surprised scientists.

The clumps in Saturn's B ring, 30 to 50 meters (100 to 160 feet) across, are
too small to be seen directly. However, scientists can map the distribution,
shape and orientation of the clumps. Colors in this image indicate the
orientation of clumps, and brightness indicates the density of ring particles.
The formation of wakes is strongest in the bluer regions, where ring particles
clump together in tilted wakes. Particles in the central yellow regions are
too densely packed for any starlight to pass through.

The ultraviolet imaging spectrograph measured the flickering of the star Alpha
Arae as it passed by the rings Nov. 9 and 10, 2006.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph was designed and built at, and the team is based at the
University of Colorado, Boulder.
