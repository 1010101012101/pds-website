Outside the soft edge of Cassini's F ring, Epimetheus and Janus negotiate
their nearly-shared orbit. The two moons' orbits are typically about 50
kilometers (30 miles) apart, and the moons actually change orbits every few
years: one moon becoming the innermost of the pair, the other becoming the
outermost.

Epimetheus' diameter is 116 kilometers (72 miles). Janus' diameter is 181
kilometers (113 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 8, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers
(1 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is about 11 kilometers (7
miles) per pixel on the two moons.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
