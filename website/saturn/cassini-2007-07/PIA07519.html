Saturn's hazy moon Titan appears to drift above Saturn's ringplane in this
view taken only a tenth of a degree above the rings. Titan's small orbital
inclination is enough to make it appear above the ringplane from this viewing
angle. Titan is 5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) across.

The Sun is below the rings in this image, so light that makes it to Cassini is
that which has been diffusely transmitted through the rings. Thus, the densest
parts of the rings appear dark in this image, and the dusty gaps in the rings,
such as the Cassini Division, appear bright.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 25, 2005, at a distance of approximately 3.2 million
kilometers (2 million miles) from Titan and at a Sun-Titan-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 50 degrees. The image scale is 19 kilometers (12 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
