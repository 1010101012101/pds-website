Cassini looks up from beneath the ringplane to spot Prometheus and Atlas
orbiting between Saturn's A and F rings.

Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) across. Atlas is 20 kilometers (12
miles) across.

The F ring displays its characteristic clumps, while scientists are watching
diligently for signs of tiny, embedded moons. Prometheus is responsible for
some of the clumpy structure in the F ring.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 28, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3 million kilometers
(1.4 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is about 13 kilometers (8
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
