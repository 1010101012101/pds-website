Two of Saturn's moons, Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) and
Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across), are seen here shepherding the
planet's narrow F-ring. Prometheus overtakes Pandora in orbit around Saturn
about every 25 days. Slightly above the pair and to the right is another moon,
Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across). The image was taken with the
narrow angle camera on the Cassini spacecraft on May 1, 2004, at a distance of
31.4 million kilometers (19.5 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 187
kilometers (116 miles) per pixel. The image has been magnified and greatly
contrast-enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
