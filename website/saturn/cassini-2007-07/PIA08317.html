This Cassini spacecraft view of Pan in the Encke gap shows hints of detail on
the moon's dark side, which is lit by saturnshine -- sunlight reflected off
Saturn.

Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles across) cruises the Encke gap (325 kilometers,
or 200 miles wide) with several faint ringlets.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 52 degrees below
the ringplane. The sunlit portion of Pan is partly overexposed.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 27, 2006 at a distance of approximately 385,000 kilometers
(239,000 miles) from Pan and at a Sun-Pan-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 86
degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
