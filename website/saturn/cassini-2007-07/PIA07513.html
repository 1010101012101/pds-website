In this fabulous close-up, Cassini peers directly through regions of the A, B
and C rings (from top to bottom here) to glimpse shadows of the very same
rings cast upon the planet's atmosphere. Near the top, shadows cast by
ringlets in the Cassini division (center) look almost like a photo negative.

This type of image helps scientists probe the rings' structure in detail and
provides information about the density of their constituent particles.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 26, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3 million
kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 14 kilometers
(9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
