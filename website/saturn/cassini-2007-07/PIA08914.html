The oblong form of Prometheus glides by, trailing behind it wiggles in
Saturn's ribbon-like F ring.

Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) causes a great deal of
perturbation to the F ring, including kinks, knots and gores in the shape of
the ring structure. By studying the moon and its interactions with the F ring
scientists are learning a great deal about how ring structures form and
evolve.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 27 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 24, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.5 million kilometers
(900,000 miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 9 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
