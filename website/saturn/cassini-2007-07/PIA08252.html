The night skies of Saturn are graced by the planet's dazzling rings, but as
this image shows, one's view could be very different depending on the season
and from which hemisphere one gazes up.

This point of view shows that the southern hemisphere is much brighter on the
planet's night side than the northern hemisphere, owing to the brilliance of
sunlight reflecting off the southern illuminated rings. The northern
hemisphere sees only the ghostly glow of the dim scattered light that manages
to penetrate the rings.

The planet's shadow eclipses the rings themselves in the lower half of this
scene, but close inspection shows ringlets in the C ring silhouetted against
the southern latitudes.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on July 25, 2006 at a distance of approximately 952,000 kilometers
(592,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of
124 degrees. Image scale is 53 kilometers (33 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
