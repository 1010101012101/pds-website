The soft, sweeping shadows of Saturn's C ring cover bright patches of clouds
in the planet's atmosphere. The shadow-throwing rings stretch across the view
at bottom. The dark inner edge of the B ring is visible at top.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 752 nanometers. The image was acquired with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on April 28, 2006 at a distance of
approximately 340,000 kilometers (211,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is
17 kilometers (10 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
