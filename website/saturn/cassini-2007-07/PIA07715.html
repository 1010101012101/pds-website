This view is part of a montage of images from the NASA Cassini and Voyager
missions shown in
[PIA07714](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07714). The inset image
from the montage is presented here by itself and in its original orientation.

Cassini has observed the D-ring at much higher resolution than was possible
for Voyager, revealing surprising fine-scale structures. This narrow-angle
camera image was taken on May 21, 2005, and shows the region between the D
ring feature named D73 and the inner edge of the C-ring at 2 kilometer (1
mile) per pixel resolution. This region contains a periodic wave-like
structure with a wavelength of 30 kilometers (19 miles). The faint horizontal
bands in the image are instrumental artifacts.

The fine structure in the D-ring (visible here) could be related to
perturbations from the planet or its magnetic field. The Cassini results
provide information about the dynamics of ring particles in a new regime \--
one very close to the planet and sparsely populated by icy particles the size
of dust.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
