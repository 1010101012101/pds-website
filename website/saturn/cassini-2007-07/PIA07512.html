This amazing close-up of Saturn's rings reveals their incredible variety. In
some regions there are wavelike structures, while in other places the rings'
structure appears to be more chaotic.

This image shows (from top to bottom) the A ring with the Encke gap, the
Cassini Division, and the B and C rings.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 26, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.3 million
kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 14 kilometers
(8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
