Prometheus draws a fresh streamer of material from the F ring as it passes the
ring's interior edge. The streamer will continuously shear out as it orbits
the planet, becoming more elongated and increasingly aligned with the F ring
with time.

A single large crater is the principle feature visible on Prometheus (102
kilometers, or 63 miles across) in this view. The moon is lit partly by bright
sunlight and partly by reflected light from Saturn.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 57 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 11, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 miles) from Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 130 degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
