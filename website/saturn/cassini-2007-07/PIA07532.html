Cassini swung in close to Saturn as it rounded the planet's night side,
beginning another orbit and moving to progressively higher elevations in order
to study the rings.

The view here is from 12 degrees above the ringplane, looking down toward the
unlit side of the rings. Sunlight shines from beneath the rings, casting thin,
curving shadows across the northern latitudes. The view of the planet is
cutoff by the dense B ring near the bottom.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on May 21, 2005, at a distance of approximately 582,000 kilometers
(362,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 35 kilometers (22 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
