The shepherd moon Prometheus is lit partly by reflected light from Saturn as
it lurks near the heavily perturbed F ring.

The left side of Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is
overexposed by the blinding Sun, but hints of craters can be seen on the
Saturn-lit side.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 52 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 16, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.8 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Prometheus. Image scale is 11 kilometers (7 miles)
per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
