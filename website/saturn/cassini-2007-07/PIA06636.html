Cassini imaging scientists use special images like this one, which shows the
far side of Saturn's rings disappearing behind the planet's outer atmosphere,
to probe the vertical structure of Saturn's high altitude haze.

This image was acquired from above Saturn's ring plane, and thus shows the
unlit side of the rings. From this perspective, the dark areas correspond to
dense regions of the rings where little light penetrates; the brighter ring
sections are less dense areas that light can pass through. Here, the bright,
outer ring is the A Ring, and the gap between the two visible rings is the
densest part of the B ring. The inner, somewhat fainter ring is the outer part
of the C ring grading into the inner B Ring. The view is toward the night side
of Saturn.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 11, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.3 million
kilometers (618,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 9 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel. The image has been contrast-enhanced and magnified by a
factor of three to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
