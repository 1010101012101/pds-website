As the closest-orbiting of Saturn's intermediate-sized moons, Mimas is
occasionally captured against the planet's dim and shadowed northern
latitudes. The moon is seen here next to the shadows cast by the dense B ring.
Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles) across.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on July
18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.6 million kilometers (1 million
miles) from Mimas and at a Sun-Mimas-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 90
degrees. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
