This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the ringed planet Saturn shows a
rare storm that appears as a white arrowhead-shaped feature near the planet's
equator. The storm is generated by an upwelling of warmer air, similar to a
terrestrial thunderhead. The east-west extent of this storm is equal to the
diameter of the Earth (about 7,900 miles). Hubble provides new details about
the effects of Saturn's prevailing winds on the storm. The new image shows
that the storm's motion and size have changed little since its discovery in
September, 1994.

The storm was imaged with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) in
the wide field mode on December 1, 1994, when Saturn was 904 million miles
from the Earth. The picture is a composite of images taken through different
color filters within a 6 minute interval to create a "true-color" rendition of
the planet. The blue fringe on the right limb of the planet is an artifact of
image processing used to compensate for the rotation of the planet between
exposures.

The Hubble images are sharp enough to reveal that Saturn's prevailing winds
shape a dark "wedge" that eats into the western (left) side of the bright
central cloud. The planet's strongest eastward winds (clocked at 1,000 miles
per hour from analysis of Voyager spacecraft images taken in 1980-81) are at
the latitude of the wedge.

To the north of this arrowhead-shaped feature, the winds decrease so that the
storm center is moving eastward relative to the local flow. The clouds
expanding north of the storm are swept westward by the winds at higher
latitudes. The strong winds near the latitude of the dark wedge blow over the
northern part of the storm, creating a secondary disturbance that generates
the faint white clouds to the east (right) of the storm center.

The storm's white clouds are ammonia ice crystals that form when an upward
flow of warmer gases shoves its way through Saturn's frigid cloud tops. This
current storm is larger than the white clouds associated with minor storms
that have been reported more frequently as bright cloud features.

Hubble observed a similar, though larger, storm in September 1990, which was
one of three major Saturn storms seen over the past two centuries. Although
these events were separated by about 57 years (approximately 2 Saturnian
years) there is yet no explanation why they apparently follow a cycle --
occurring when it is summer in Saturn's northern hemisphere.
