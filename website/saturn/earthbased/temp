The Slant on Saturn's Rings

This is a series of images of Saturn, as seen at many different 
wavelengths, when the planet's rings were at a maximum tilt of 
27 degrees toward Earth. Saturn experiences seasonal tilts away 
from and toward the Sun, much the same way Earth does. This 
happens over the course of its 29.5-year orbit. This means that 
approximately every 30 years, Earth observers can catch their 
best glimpse of Saturn's South Pole and the southern side of the 
planet's rings. Between March and April 2003, researchers took 
full advantage to study the gas giant at maximum tilt. They used 
NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to capture detailed images of 
Saturn's Southern Hemisphere and the southern face of its rings.  </p>
<p>The telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 used 30 filters to 
snap these images on March 7, 2003. The filters span a range of 
wavelengths. "The set of 30 selected filters may be the best 
spectral coverage of Saturn observations ever obtained," says 
planetary researcher Erich Karkoschka of the University of Arizona. 
Various wavelengths of light allow researchers to see important 
characteristics of Saturn's atmosphere. Particles in Saturn's 
atmosphere reflect different wavelengths of light in discrete 
ways, causing some bands of gas in the atmosphere to stand out 
vividly in an image, while other areas will be very dark or dull. 
One image cannot stand by itself because one feature may have 
several interpretations. In fact, only by combining and comparing 
these different images, in a set such as this one, can researchers 
interpret the data and better understand the planet.  </p>
<p>By examining the hazes and clouds present in these images, 
researchers can learn about the dynamics of Saturn's atmosphere. 
Scientists gain insight into the structure and gaseous composition 
of Saturn's clouds via inspection of images such as these taken by 
the Hubble telescope. Over several wavelength bands, from infrared 
to ultraviolet, these images reveal the properties and sizes of 
aerosols in Saturn's gaseous makeup. For example, smaller aerosols 
are visible only in the ultraviolet image, because they do not 
scatter or absorb visible or infrared light, which have longer 
wavelengths. By determining the characteristics of the atmosphere's 
constituents, researchers can describe the dynamics of cloud 
formation. At certain visible and infrared wavelengths, light 
absorption by methane gas blocks all but the uppermost layers of 
Saturn's atmosphere, which helps researchers discern clouds at 
different altitudes. In addition, when compared with images of 
Saturn from seasons past (1991 and 1995), this view of the planet 
also offers scientists a better comprehension of Saturn's seasonal 
changes.</p><p class="credit"><span class="import">Credit:</span> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> and E.
