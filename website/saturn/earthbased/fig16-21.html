**Caption:**

Whenever Saturn's rings appear nearly edge on as seen from Earth, observers
take advantage of the much-reduced glare from the main bands to search for
faint rings and satellites. Saturn's E and G rings extend beyond the classical
ring system in this infrared (2.27-micron) image obtained on 10 August 1995 by
the Keck I telescope. The G ring is so faint it was never before seen from a
ground-based telescope. The E ring's brightness peaks very near the orbit of
Enceladus, the moon believed to be responsible for its microscopic particles.
Although not obvious here, the E ring gets wider vertically as the distance
from Saturn increases.
