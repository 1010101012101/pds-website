**Caption:**

This is the first image of Saturns ultraviolet aurora taken by the
 Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space
 Telescope in October 1997, when Saturn was a distance of 810 million
 miles (1.3 billion kilometers) from Earth. The new instrument, used as
 a camera, provides more than ten times the sensitivity of previous
 Hubble instruments in the ultraviolet. STIS images reveal exquisite
 detail never before seen in the spectacular auroral curtains of light
 that encircle Saturns north and south poles and rise more than a
 thousand miles above the cloud tops.
 
 Saturns auroral displays are caused by an energetic wind from the Sun
 that sweeps over the planet, much like the Earths aurora that is
 occasionally seen in the nighttime sky and similar to the phenomenon
 that causes fluorescent lamps to glow.  But unlike the Earth, Saturns
 aurora is only seen in ultraviolet light that is invisible from the
 Earths surface, hence the aurora can only be observed from space. New
 Hubble images reveal ripples and overall patterns that evolve slowly,
 appearing generally fixed in our view and independent of planet
 rotation. At the same time, the curtains show local brightening that
 often follow the rotation of the planet and exhibit rapid variations
 on time scales of minutes. These variations and regularities indicate
 that the aurora is primarily shaped and powered by a continual
 tug-of-war between Saturns magnetic field and the flow of charged
 particles from the Sun.
 
  Study of the aurora on Saturn had its beginnings just seventeen years
 ago. The Pioneer 11 spacecraft observed a far-ultraviolet brightening
 on Saturns poles in 1979. The Saturn flybys of the Voyager 1 and 2
 spacecraft in the early 1980s provided a basic description of the
 aurora and mapped for the first time planets enormous magnetic field
 that guides energetic electrons into the atmosphere near the north and
 south poles.
 
 The first images of Saturns aurora were provided in 1994-5 by the
 Hubble Space Telescopes Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC2). Much
 greater ultraviolet sensitivity of the new STIS instrument allows the
 workings of Saturns magnetosphere and upper atmosphere to be studied
 in much greater detail. These Hubble aurora investigations provide a
 framework that will ultimately complement the in situ measurements of
 Saturns magnetic field and charged particles by NASA/ ESAs Cassini
 spacecraft, now en route to its rendezvous with Saturn early in the
 next decade.
 
 
 Two STIS imaging modes have been used to discriminate between
 ultraviolet emissions predominantly from hydrogen atoms (shown in red)
 and emissions due to molecular hydrogen (shown in blue). Hence the
 bright red aurora features are dominated by atomic hydrogen, while the
 white traces within them map the more tightly confined regions of
 molecular hydrogen emissions. The southern aurora is seen at lower
 right, the northern at upper left.
