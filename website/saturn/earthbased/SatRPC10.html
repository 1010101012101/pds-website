This series of 10 Hubble Space Telescope images captures several small moons
orbiting Saturn. Hubble snapped the five pairs of images while the Earth was
just above the ring plane and the Sun below it. The telescope captured a pair
of images every 97 minutes as it circled the Earth. Moving out from Saturn,
the visible rings are: the broad C Ring, the Cassini Division, and the narrow
F Ring.
