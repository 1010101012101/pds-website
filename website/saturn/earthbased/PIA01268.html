**Caption:**

In honor of NASA Hubble Space Telescope's eighth anniversary, we have
 gift wrapped Saturn in vivid colors. Actually, this image is courtesy
 of the new Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer
 (NICMOS), which has taken its first peek at Saturn. The false-color
 image - taken Jan. 4, 1998 - shows the planet's reflected infrared
 light. This view provides detailed information on the clouds and hazes
 in Saturn's atmosphere.
 
 The blue colors indicate a clear atmosphere down to a main cloud
 layer. Different shadings of blue indicate variations in the cloud
 particles, in size or chemical composition. The cloud particles are
 believed to be ammonia ice crystals.  Most of the northern hemisphere
 that is visible above the rings is relatively clear. The dark region
 around the south pole at the bottom indicates a big hole in the main
 cloud layer.
 
 The green and yellow colors indicate a haze above the main cloud
 layer. The haze is thin where the colors are green but thick where
 they are yellow. Most of the southern hemisphere (the lower part of
 Saturn) is quite hazy. These layers are aligned with latitude lines,
 due to Saturn's east-west winds. < P>The red and orange colors
 indicate clouds reaching up high into the atmosphere. Red clouds are
 even higher than orange clouds. The densest regions of two storms near
 Saturn's equator appear white. On Earth, the storms with the highest
 clouds are also found in tropical latitudes. The smaller storm on the
 left is about as large as the Earth, and larger storms have been
 recorded on Saturn in 1990 and 1994.
 
 The rings, made up of chunks of ice, are as white as images of ice
 taken in visible light. However, in the infrared, water absorption
 causes various colorations. The most obvious is the brown color of the
 innermost ring.  The rings cast their shadow onto Saturn. The bright
 line seen within this shadow is sunlight shining through the Cassini
 Division, the separation between the two bright rings. It is best
 observed on the left side, just above the rings. This view is possible
 due to a rare geometry during the observation. The next time this is
 observable from Earth will be in 2006.  An accurate investigation of
 the ring's shadow also shows sunlight shining through the Encke Gap, a
 thin division very close to the outer edge of the ring system.
 
 Two of Saturn's satellites were recorded, Dione on the lower left and
 Tethys on the upper right. Tethys is just ending its transit across
 the disk of Saturn. They appear in different colors, yellow and green,
 indicating different conditions on their icy surfaces.
 
 Wavelengths: A color image consists of three exposures (or three film
 layers). For visible true-color images, the wavelengths of these three
 exposures are 0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 micrometers for blue, green, and red
 light, respectively. This Saturn image was taken at longer infrared
 wavelengths of 1.0, 1.8, and 2.1 micrometers, displayed as blue,
 green, and red. Reflected sunlight is seen at all these wavelengths,
 since Saturn's own heat glows only at wavelengths above 4
 micrometers.
