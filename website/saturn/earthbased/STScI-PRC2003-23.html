This is a series of images of Saturn, as seen at many different wavelengths,
when the planet's rings were at a maximum tilt of 27 degrees toward Earth.
Saturn experiences seasonal tilts away from and toward the Sun, much the same
way Earth does. This happens over the course of its 29.5-year orbit. This
means that approximately every 30 years, Earth observers can catch their best
glimpse of Saturn's South Pole and the southern side of the planet's rings.
Between March and April 2003, researchers took full advantage to study the gas
giant at maximum tilt. They used NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to capture
detailed images of Saturn's Southern Hemisphere and the southern face of its
rings.

The telescope's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 used 30 filters to snap these
images on March 7, 2003. The filters span a range of wavelengths. "The set of
30 selected filters may be the best spectral coverage of Saturn observations
ever obtained," says planetary researcher Erich Karkoschka of the University
of Arizona. Various wavelengths of light allow researchers to see important
characteristics of Saturn's atmosphere. Particles in Saturn's atmosphere
reflect different wavelengths of light in discrete ways, causing some bands of
gas in the atmosphere to stand out vividly in an image, while other areas will
be very dark or dull. One image cannot stand by itself because one feature may
have several interpretations. In fact, only by combining and comparing these
different images, in a set such as this one, can researchers interpret the
data and better understand the planet.

By examining the hazes and clouds present in these images, researchers can
learn about the dynamics of Saturn's atmosphere. Scientists gain insight into
the structure and gaseous composition of Saturn's clouds via inspection of
images such as these taken by the Hubble telescope. Over several wavelength
bands, from infrared to ultraviolet, these images reveal the properties and
sizes of aerosols in Saturn's gaseous makeup. For example, smaller aerosols
are visible only in the ultraviolet image, because they do not scatter or
absorb visible or infrared light, which have longer wavelengths. By
determining the characteristics of the atmosphere's constituents, researchers
can describe the dynamics of cloud formation. At certain visible and infrared
wavelengths, light absorption by methane gas blocks all but the uppermost
layers of Saturn's atmosphere, which helps researchers discern clouds at
different altitudes. In addition, when compared with images of Saturn from
seasons past (1991 and 1995), this view of the planet also offers scientists a
better comprehension of Saturn's seasonal changes.
