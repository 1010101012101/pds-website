**Caption:**

This is a rare view of Saturn's rings seen just after the Sun has set
 below the ring plane, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope on
 Nov. 21, 1995.
 
 This perspective is unusual because the Earth is slightly above (2.7
 degrees latitude) Saturn's rings and the Sun is below them. Normally
 we see the rings fully illuminated by the Sun.
 
 The photograph shows three bright ring features: the F Ring, the
 Cassini Division, and the C Ring (moving from the outer rings to the
 inner). The low concentration of material in these rings allows light
 from the Sun to shine through them. The A and B rings are much denser,
 which limits the amount of light that penetrates through
 them. Instead, they are faintly visible because they reflect light
 from Saturn's disk.
 
 Scientists believe that the F Ring is slightly warped because it
 disappears part way around on the right (West) side. Hubble's high
 resolution shows the that A Ring's shadow obscures part of the F ring
 (right).
 
 The image was assembled from 20 exposures taken with Wide Field
 Planetary Camera-2 over 8 hours.
