**Caption: **

This sequence of images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope documents a rare
astronomical alignment -- Saturn's magnificent ring system turned edge-on.
This occurs when the Earth passes through Saturn's ring plane, as it does
approximately every 15 years.

These pictures were taken with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 on 22
May 1995, when Saturn was at a distance of 919 million miles (1.5 billion
kilometers) from Earth. At Saturn, Hubble can see details as small as 450
miles (725 km) across. In each image, the dark band across Saturn is the ring
shadow cast by the Sun which is still 2.7 degrees above Saturn's ring plane.
The box around the western portion of the rings (to the right of Saturn) in
each image indicates the area in which the faint light from the rings has been
multiplied through image processing (by a factor of 25) to make the rings more
visible.

[Top] -

This image was taken while the Earth was above the lit face of the rings. The
moons Tethys and Dione are visible to the east (left) of Saturn; Janus is the
bright spot near the center of the ring portion in the box, and Pandora is
faintly visible just inside the left edge of this box. Saturn's atmosphere
shows remarkable detail: multiple banding in both the northern and southern
hemispheres, wispy structure at the north edge of the equatorial zone, and a
bright area above the ring shadow that is caused by sunlight scattered off the
rings onto the atmosphere. There is evidence of a faint polar haze over the
north pole of Saturn and a fainter haze over the south.

[Center] -

This image was taken close to the time of ring- plane crossing. The rings are
75% fainter than in the top image, though they do not disappear completely
because the vertical face of the rings still reflects sunlight when the rings
are edge-on. Rhea is visible to the east of Saturn, Enceladus is the bright
satellite in the rings to the west, and Janus is the fainter blip to its
right. Pandora is just to the left of Enceladus, but is not visible because
Enceladus is too bright. An oval-shaped atmospheric feature has just rotated
into view (near the eastern limb, at the northern edge of the equatorial
zone), and appears to be a local circulation pattern that is not penetrated by
the bright clouds that are deflected around it.

[Bottom] -

This image was taken approximately 96 minutes (one Hubble orbit) after the
center image. The rings are 10% brighter than they were in that image. Rhea is
visible just off the eastern limb of Saturn, and casts a shadow on the south
face of Saturn. During this exposure, the Earth and Sun were on opposite sides
of Saturn's ring plane (they remain in this configuration until 10 August
1995). The atmospheric circulation pattern has rotated to just past the center
of the planet's disk, and is followed by more wispy structure in the bright
band of clouds, reminiscent of the structure seen during the Saturn storm
observed in 1990\.

These images will be used to determine the time of ring-plane crossing and the
thickness of the main rings and to search for as yet undiscovered satellites.
Knowledge of the exact time of ring-plane crossing will lead to an improved
determination of the rate at which Saturn 'wobbles' about its axis (polar
precession).

Technical Notes Each of these images is a 7-second exposure at 8922 Angstroms
in a methane absorption band. North is up and east is to the left.
