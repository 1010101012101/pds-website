**Caption:**

In one of nature's most dramatic examples of 'now-you see-them,
 now-you-don't', NASA's Hubble Space Telescope captured Saturn on May
 22, 1995 as the planet's magnificent ring system turned edge-on.  This
 ring-plane crossing occurs approximately every 15 years when the Earth
 passes through Saturn's ring plane.
 
 For comparison, the top picture was taken by Hubble on December 1,
 1994 and shows the rings in a more familiar configuration for Earth
 observers.
 
 The bottom picture was taken shortly before the ring plane
 crossing. The rings do not disappear completely because the edge of
 the rings reflects sunlight. The dark band across the middle of Saturn
 is the shadow of the rings cast on the planet (the Sun is almost 3
 degrees above the ring plane.) The bright stripe directly above the
 ring shadow is caused by sunlight reflected off the rings onto
 Saturn's atmosphere. Two of Saturn's icy moons are visible as tiny
 starlike objects in or near the ring plane. They are, from left to
 right, Tethys (slightly above the ring plane) and Dione.
 
 This observation will be used to determine the time of ring-plane
 crossing and the thickness of the main rings and to search for as yet
 undiscovered satellites. Knowledge of the exact time of ring-plane
 crossing will lead to an improved determination of the rate at which
 Saturn 'wobbles' about its axis (polar precession).
 
 Both pictures were taken with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera
 2. The top image was taken in visible light.  Saturn's disk appears
 different in the bottom image because a narrowband filter (which only
 lets through light that is not absorbed by methane gas in Saturn's
 atmosphere) was used to reduce the bright glare of the planet. Though
 Saturn is approximately 900 million miles away, Hubble can see details
 as small as 450 miles across.
