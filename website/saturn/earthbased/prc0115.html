**Caption:**

Looming like a giant flying saucer in our outer solar system, Saturn puts on a
show as the planet and its magnificent ring system nod majestically over the
course of its 29-year journey around the Sun. These Hubble Space Telescope
images, captured from 1996 to 2000, show Saturn's rings open up from just past
edge-on to nearly fully open as it moves from autumn towards winter in its
Northern Hemisphere.

Saturn's equator is tilted relative to its orbit by 27 degrees, very similar
to the 23-degree tilt of the Earth. As Saturn moves along its orbit, first one
hemisphere, then the other is tilted towards the Sun. This cyclical change
causes seasons on Saturn, just as the changing orientation of Earth's tilt
causes seasons on our planet. The first image in this sequence, on the lower
left, was taken soon after the autumnal equinox in Saturn's Northern
Hemisphere (which is the same as the spring equinox in its Southern
Hemisphere). By the final image in the sequence, on the upper right, the tilt
is nearing its extreme, or winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere (summer
solstice in the Southern Hemisphere).

Astronomers are studying this set of images to investigate the detailed
variations in the color and brightness of the rings. They hope to learn more
about the rings' composition, how they were formed, and how long they might
last. Saturn's rings are incredibly thin, with a thickness of only about 30
feet (10 meters). The rings are made of dusty water ice, in the form of
boulder-sized and smaller chunks that gently collide with each other as they
orbit around Saturn. Saturn's gravitational field constantly disrupts these
ice chunks, keeping them spread out and preventing them from combining to form
a moon. The rings, as shown here, have a slight pale reddish color due to the
presence of organic material mixed with the water ice.

Saturn is about 75,000 miles (120,000 km) across, and is flattened at the
poles because of its very rapid rotation. A day is only 10 hours long on
Saturn. Strong winds account for the horizontal bands in the atmosphere of
this giant gas planet. The delicate color variations in the clouds are due to
smog in the upper atmosphere, produced when ultraviolet radiation from the Sun
shines on methane gas. Deeper in the atmosphere, the visible clouds and gases
merge gradually into hotter and denser gases, with no solid surface for
visiting spacecraft to land on.

The Cassini/Huygens spacecraft, launched from Earth in 1997, is well on its
way to the Saturn system. It will arrive in 2004 to land a probe on Titan,
Saturn's largest moon, and to orbit the planet for four years for a detailed
study of the entire Saturn system.

These images of Saturn, taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 onboard
Hubble, were collected by Richard French (Wellesley College), Jeff Cuzzi
(NASA/Ames), Luke Dones (SwRI), and Jack Lissauer (NASA/Ames), and have been
prepared for presentation by the Hubble Heritage Team.
