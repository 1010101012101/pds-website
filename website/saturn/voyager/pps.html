Voyager 2 PPS Pseudo Images

# Voyager 2 PPS Pseudo Images  
(August 1981)

The Voyager 2 PPS
[(Photopolarimeter)](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/voyager/pps/) instrument
performed a stellar
[occultation](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#occultation)
experiment at Saturn. Because of the instrument's high sensitivity and the
small apparent size of the star used, delta Scorpii, structure was observed on
a much finer scale---hundreds of meters---than would otherwise be possible.
For comparison, the finest resolution obtained by the Voyager cameras was
about 10 km. These synthetic images have been generated by "smearing out"
sections of the one-dimensional occultation profile into two-dimensional
pseudo-images. Regions of higher [optical
depth](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#optical_depth) appear
brighter in the images.

F Ring](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/voyager/saturn36.gif) (Color
GIF, 32 kbytes).

This synthesized images shows very fine structure Saturn's F Ring, including a
dense outer core and a diffuse set of inner strands. Note that the uniformity
and lack of kinks or knots here are only artifacts of the
[occultation](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#occultation)
experiment, which takes a single narrow slice of the rings.  [

near the Encke
Gap](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/voyager/saturn37.gif) (Color GIF,
45 kbytes).

This synthesized images shows fine structure around the Encke Gap in Saturn's
outer A Ring. The regular stripes inward from the ring (right) are caused by
the gravitational [shepherding](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/glossary.html#s
hepherding_satellite) of the tiny embedded moon Pan. In fact, it was the
analysis of this data set, combined with others, that made it possible first
to predict the existence of Pan and then to detect it in the Voyager images.
The fainter ringlet in the middle of the gap (in red) probably consists of
dust escaping off the surface of Pan and stabilized by Pan's gravity. This
image has a resolution of about 1 km.  [

Patterns near the Keeler
Gap](http://ringmaster.arc.nasa.gov/saturn/voyager/saturn41.gif) (Color GIF,
129 kbytes).

One of the most exciting discoveries by Voyager was the presence of wave
patterns in the rings. This synthesized image shows wave patterns surrounding
the Keeler Gap, and 50-km opening near the outer edge of the A Ring. The image
has a resolution of about 1 km.
