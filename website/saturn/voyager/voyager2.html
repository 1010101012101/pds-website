# Voyager 2 Images of Saturn's Ring System  
(August 1981)

[ ![](/saturn/voyager/plate_05-tn.gif) The Cassini Division and the A
Ring](/saturn/voyager/plate_05.gif) (Color GIF, 239 kbytes).

Saturn's outer A Ring in false color, constructed from Voyager 2 green,
violet, and ultraviolet frames. The Cassini Division (lower right) is
distinctly less red than the A Ring. Also visible, as a sequence of dark
features in the outermost A Ring, is a series of orbital resonances with
Saturn's inner moons. The 325 km wide Encke Division (upper left center)
contains the tiny moon Pan. However, the cause of the narrower Keeler Gap
(closer to the outer edge of the A Ring) and the gaps in the Cassini Division
is not known.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/plate_06-tn.gif) The B and C Rings in
False Color](/saturn/voyager/plate_06.gif) (Color GIF, 306 kbytes).

The outer part of Saturn's C Ring (blue) and the inner part of the B Ring
(yellow) are shown here in false color. The color difference blurs over the
boundary between the rings. The Maxwell Gap and its eccentric ringlet, which
appears yellow due to image mis-alignment, are in the left center of this
frame.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn53-tn.gif) Chemistry of the
Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn53.gif) (Color GIF, 400 kbytes).

This highly enhanced false color view of Saturn's rings was assembled from
clear, orange and ultraviolet images. Possible variations in chemical
composition from one part of Saturn's ring system to another are visible as
subtle color variations. In addition to the previously known blue color of the
C Ring and the Cassini Division, the picture shows additional color
differences (red-green) within and between the A and B Rings. The distance to
Saturn was 8.9 million kilometers (5.5 million miles).  [

Ring](/saturn/voyager/c4364334.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 288 kbytes).

Voyager 2 image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 43643.34 shows a distinct pattern of
"spokes" in the B Ring, which is the broad, bright, middle ring of Saturn's
three main rings. The spokes are made of dust that has been raised off of the
ring particles, but the reason the spokes appear is unknown.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/saturn20-tn.gif) The Birth of a
Spoke](/saturn/voyager/saturn20.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 91 kbytes).

Contrast enhancement reveals numerous spokes in the B Ring. In a sequence of
four Voyager 2 images (shown here as inset panels), a small spoke is seen to
appear in between several more prominent spokes. The arrow in the fourth inset
image points to the new spoke.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn40a-tn.gif) Spokes
in Forward-Scattered Light](/saturn/voyager/saturn40a.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 67
kbytes).

After passing Saturn, Voyager 2 viewed the B Ring in forward-scattered light.
The spokes, seen previously as dark streaks, are now seen as bright streaks
from this [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle). This indicates that the
spokes are caused by tiny dust grains, comparable in size to the wavelength of
light.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/c4390447-tn.gif) Structure in the B
Ring](/saturn/voyager/c4390447.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 295 kbytes).

The B Ring is made up of narrow ringlets down to the limit of the image
resolution. Some darker spokes are also visible. The Cassini Division is
visible at upper right, and the A Ring is outside it; the C Ring is visible at
lower right. This Voyager 2 image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 43904.47.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/c4393531-tn.gif) The B and C
Rings](/saturn/voyager/c4393531.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 296 kbytes).

A closeup of the transition from the faint inner C Ring to the much brighter B
Ring. Both rings show fine structure at many scales. This is Voyager 2 image
[FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 43935.31.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn34-tn.gif)
Closeup of the B Ring](/saturn/voyager/saturn34.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 146
kbytes).

This is one of Voyager 2's closest looks at the B Ring, from August 25, 1981
at a distance of 743,000 km. The contrast has been enhanced to show the fine
structure. The portion of the ring shown here is 6000 km wide and features as
narrow as 10 km are visible.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/c4398946-tn.gif) Closeup
of the Cassini Division](/saturn/voyager/c4398946.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 281
kbytes).

The Cassini Division, separating Saturn's A and B Rings, is maintained by the
2:1 [resonance](/glossary.html#resonance) with Mimas. It was once thought to
be empty, but this closeup view, Voyager 2 image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds)
43989.46, shows that it really contains several broad belts of material
separated by empty "rifts".  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/pan-tn.gif) The Discovery
of Pan](/saturn/voyager/pan.gif) (Color GIF, 55 kbytes).

The 10-km moon Pan [shepherds](/glossary.html#shepherding_satellite) open the
325 km wide Encke Gap in the outer part of Saturn's A Ring. This is the
Voyager image in which is was discovered, [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 43918.04.
The region inside the green box is enlarged and enhanced as an inset at upper
right to show Pan more clearly.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn92-tn.gif) F Ring
and Shepherds](/saturn/voyager/saturn92.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 82 kbytes).

Two tiny moons, Pandora and Prometheus, are seen here
[shepherding](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) the F Ring. Prometheus, the
inner shepherd, orbits faster and had just overtaken Pandora before this image
was taken.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn81-tn.gif) F Ring and
Prometheus](/saturn/voyager/saturn81.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 78 kbytes).

This image shows Prometheus next to the F Ring. Prometheus is one of the
[shepherd](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) moons associated with the F
Ring. This image was taken on August 25, 1981 from a distance of 365,000 km.
Note that the moon is distinctly elongated.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/c4400649-tn.gif) Crossing the Ring
Plane](/saturn/voyager/c4400649.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 141 kbytes).

Image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 44006.49 shows the F Ring
[ansa](/glossary.html#ansa) just before Voyager 2 passed through the ring
plane on August 26, 1981. The F Ring seems to be made up of a number of
separate strands. In addition, the whole region inside the F Ring is not
black, indicating that it is filled with fine dust.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager
/saturn35a-tn.gif) The Foreshortened Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn35a.gif)
(B&amp;W; GIF, 72 kbytes).

The last image taken by Voyager 2 just before it crossed Saturn's ring plane
on August 26, 1981. The entire ring system is shown, but it is very nearly
edge-on and highly foreshortened. The F Ring shows up prominently in the
foreground.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn19-tn.gif) Dark Side of the
Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn19.gif) (Color GIF, 28 kbytes).

This color-enhanced Voyager 2 image shows the unlit side of the rings. Since
the broad B Ring is very [optically thick](/glossary.html#optical_depth), very
little light gets through so it appears very dark here. The A and C Rings let
more light through so they appear brighter. The unlit side of the rings is
rarely visible from Earth, except during the period of ring plane crossings
such as occurred in 1995.
