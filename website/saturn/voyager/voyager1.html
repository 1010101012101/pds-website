# Voyager 1 Images of Saturn's Ring System  
(November 1980)

[ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn55-tn.gif) The A and B
Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn55.gif) (Color GIF, 204 Kbytes).

This enhanced color image shows the outer half of Saturn's main ring system.
The dark Cassini Division near the middle divides the outer A Ring from the B
Ring. The Cassini Division was once thought to be empty, but this view shows
that it contains several fainter ring structures. The most prominent structure
in the A Ring is the Encke Gap, about 1/3 way from the ring's outer edge. This
gap is ["shepherded"](/glossary.html#shepherding_satellite). open by the tiny
embedded moon Pan. The B Ring is more densely packed with material than the A
Ring (i.e., higher in [optical depth](/glossary.html#optical_depth)) so it
shows up as brighter in this image at a low [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle). Several faint "spokes" are visible as dark
streaks across the B Ring. Much better images of the B Ring's spokes were
acquired by [Voyager 2](/saturn/voyager/voyager2.html) about nine months
later. At lower right, you can see the outer tip of the much fainter C Ring.
[ ![](/saturn/voyager/plate_02-tn.gif) Looking Back at Saturn's
Rings](/saturn/voyager/plate_02.gif) (Color GIF, 186 Kbytes).

This image, in enhanced color, was taken by Voyager 1 looking back at Saturn
after the encounter, from about 1.5 million km. At this high [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle), the dusty F Ring comes into view; it is
the very narrow and somewhat clumpy ringlet just outside the main rings. A
diffuse, spoke is seen crossing the brightest part of the B Ring; in this
lighting geometry the spokes Ring appear bright rather than dark, suggesting
that they are made of fine dust. The innermost C Ring is darker than the
others due both to darker particles and fewer of them; its characteristic
banded appearance is quite different from the A and B Rings, but similar to
the structure in the Cassini Division (the dark area between the A and B
Rings. The C Ring's brightness increases toward the left due to increased
illumination from Saturn's lit face.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/c3495655-tn.gif)
The Rings in Forward-Scattered Light](/saturn/voyager/c3495655.gif) (B&amp;W;
GIF, 328 Kbytes).

As the [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) increases, the dusty F Ring
and the spokes get brighter and brighter. This is Voyager 1 image
[FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 34956.55.  [ ![](/saturn/voyager/saturn84-tn.gif)
The Dark Side of the A and B Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn84.gif) (Color GIF,
66 Kbytes).

The contrast of the rings reverses when you look at their unlit face. Very
little light manages to scatter through the dense and [optically
thick](/glossary.html#optical_depth) B Ring (at right), so it appears much
darker than the others. The Cassini Division is brightest of all, because
light has an easy time scattering through this faint cloud of material. False
color has been used in this image to enhance subtle variations in the color
(and therefore the composition) of the ring material.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/saturn85-tn.gif) The Dark Side of the B and C
Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn85.gif) (Color GIF, 102 Kbytes).

This image is very similar to the one above, but the point of view is shifted
inward to show the B and C Rings. The C Ring is [optically
thin](/glossary#optical_depth) so sunlight scatters through it easily, making
it brighter than the B Ring in this lighting geometry. Viewing the ring's
unlit face, something can appear dark for one of two reasons, either because
it is nearly opaque (like the B Ring at left) or because it is almost
completely transparent (like the region inside the C Ring at right). In the
former case there is too much material for light to leak through, whereas in
the latter case there is no material to scatter the light. Enhanced false
color has been used to show subtle color variations in the rings.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/saturn_rings-tn.gif) Optical Depth of the
Rings](/saturn/voyager/saturn_rings.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 339 Kbytes).

This Voyager image shows the rings passing in front of the planet. As a
result, you can see which rings are opaque [(optically
thick)](/glossary.html#optical_depth) and which are transparent (optically
thin). Part of the middle B Ring obscures the planet completely, while the
planet easily shines through the fainter, inner C Ring.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/c3493048-tn.gif) Closeup of the "Braided" F
Ring](/saturn/voyager/c3493048.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 125 Kbytes).

This closeup view of Saturn's F Ring is from Voyager 1 image
[FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 34930.48. It shows that the ring is composed of two
bright strands and a fainter one inside them. The bright rings contain bends,
kinks and bright clumps that give the illusion that these strands are braided.
These features may be caused by the small gravitational effects of the nearby
[shepherding moons](/glossary.html#shepherding_satellite) Pandora and
Prometheus. The grid of black dots in the image are
[reseau](/glossary.html#reseau) markings.  [
![](/saturn/voyager/c3493353-tn.gif) Rings and
Mimas](/saturn/voyager/c3493353.gif) (B&amp;W; GIF, 295 Kbytes).

This striking image was taken looking across the dark side of Saturn's rings,
with Mimas in the background. The narrow F Ring is visible outside the A and B
Rings.
