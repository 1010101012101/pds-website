HUBBLE CAPTURES RARE EVENT AS SATURN'S RINGS APPEAR EDGE-ON
<P>
       In one of nature's most dramatic examples of "now-
you-see-them, now-you-don't," NASA's Hubble Space Telescope 
captured images of Saturn on May 22, 1995 as the planet's 
magnificent ring system turned edge-on as viewed from Earth.  
This event occurs about every 15 years.  
<P>
       This observation will be used to determine the time 
of ring-plane crossing and the thickness of the main rings, 
to search for as yet undiscovered satellites and to help 
better determine the rate at which Saturn "wobbles" about 
its axis in a process known as polar precession.
<P>
       The image is available to news media representatives 
by calling the Broadcast & Imaging Branch at 202/358-1900.  
The NASA photo number is:

       The image and two others (two three-panel images 
showing Saturn at three different times around ring-plane 
crossing, one of which is labeled with names of satellites 
and times of observation) will be available electronically 
via the Internet in GIF and JPEG format and may be accessed 
on Internet via anonymous ftp from ftp.stsci.edu in the 
/pubinfo directory.
