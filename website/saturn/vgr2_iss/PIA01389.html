**Caption:**

This was one of the first pictures obtained once Voyager 2 resumed
 returning images Aug. 29 after its scan platform was commanded to view
 Saturn.  Problems with the platform, on which Voyager's cameras and
 other instruments are mounted, had prevented the return of images for
 a few days.  This view shows some detail and differences in the
 complex system of rings.  The "reddening" of the B ring on the unlit
 side also was seen in Voyager 1 images.  Voyager 2 obtained this
 picture from a range 3.4 million kilometers (2.1 million miles)
 through the clear, green and violet filters.  The Voyager project is
 managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
 Calif.
