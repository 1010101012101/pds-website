**Caption:**

Voyager 2 took this high-resolution image of Saturn's F ring Aug.  26
 from a distance of 51,500 kilometers (32,000 miles).  This closeup
 view shows that the ring is made up of at least four distinct
 components.  A higher-resolution scan through the F ring, the result
 of the star [occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiment conducted by the spacecraft's
 photopolarimeter, showed even finer structure in the ring.  Voyager 1
 showed a braiding effect not evident in this picture.  The small black
 dots are [reseau](/glossary.html#reseau) (reference) marks on the camera.  The small bright
 dash in the middle right of the image is a star trail.  The Voyager
 project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
 Pasadena, Calif.
