Image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 43993.50 captured a closeup of a pair of waves
at the 5:3 [resonance](/glossary.html#resonance) with the moon Mimas. The
inner wave (right) is a spiral bending wave, made of vertical oscillations in
the rings. It is visible because the peaks cast shadows over the troughs. The
outer wave (left) is a spiral density wave, in which particles are bunched
together in a spiral pattern. The distance between the two waves is about 400
km. **Image Note:**      Image courtesy of [Mark Showalter](/showalter.html)
