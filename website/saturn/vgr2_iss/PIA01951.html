**Caption:**

Saturn's F ring and its inner <A HREF="/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite">shepherding satellite</A> (1980S27) are
 pictured in this closeup Voyager 2 image acquired Aug. 25 from a range
 of 365,000 kilometers (227,000 miles).  Features as small as 6
 km. (3.7 mi.) across are visible.  The satellite is elongated and
 irregular, with its longest axis pointing toward the center of Saturn
 (toward the upper right in this view).  As seen here, the F ring is
 thin and does not show the multiple, braided structure Voyager 1 saw
 last fall.  Nor is there any indication of a band or kink in the ring
 at its closest point to the <A HREF="/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite">shepherd</A>; such a feature would be
 consistent with some of the theories advanced on the formation of the
 braids.  The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
