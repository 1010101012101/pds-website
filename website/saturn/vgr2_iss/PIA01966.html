**Caption:**

Voyager 2 returned this view of Saturn and its ring system Aug.  11,
 when the spacecraft was 13.9 million kilometers (8.6 million miles)
 away and approaching the large, gaseous planet at about l million
 km. (620,000 mi.) a day.  The ring system's shadow is clearly cast in
 the equatorial region.  Storm clouds and small- scale spots in the
 mid-latitudes are apparent.  The so-called ìribbonlikeî feature
 in the white cloud band marks a high-speed jet at about 47 north;
 there, the westerly wind speeds are about 150 meters-per-second (330
 mph).  The banding on this large, gaseous planet extends toward both
 poles.  The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
