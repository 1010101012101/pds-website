**Caption:**

This long exposure of the ring region about 150,000 to 200,000
 kilometers (90,000 to 120,000 miles) from the center of Saturn
 captured the very faint G ring, seen at left. The ring was discovered
 by Voyager 1 last fall at a similar <A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A>.  Voyager 2 was about
 305,000 km. (189,000 mi.) away when it took this image Aug. 26.  The
 small rectangular dots forming a regular pattern are <A HREF="/glossary.html#reseau">reseau</A>
 (reference) marks on the Voyager vidicon camera.  The high-resolution
 detail in the A ring has been washed out by the very long exposure
 needed to bring out the very tenuous G ring.  The Voyager project is
 managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
 Calif.
