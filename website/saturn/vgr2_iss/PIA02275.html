**Caption:**

Voyager 2 obtained this high-resolution picture of Saturn's rings Aug.
 22, when the spacecraft was 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles)
 away. Evident here are the numerous 'spoke' features,in the B Ring;
 their very sharp, narrow appearance suggests short formation times.
 Scientists think electromagnetic forces are responsible in some way for
 these features, but no detailed theory has been worked out. Pictures
 such as this and analyses of Voyager 2's spoke movies may reveal more
 clues about the origins of these complex structures. The Voyager
 project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
 Calif.
