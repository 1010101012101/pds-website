**Caption: **

Voyager 2 obtained this high-resolution picture of Saturn's rings Aug. 22,
when the spacecraft was 4 million kilometers (2.5 million miles) away. Evident
here are the numerous 'spoke' features,in the B Ring; their very sharp, narrow
appearance suggests short formation times. Scientists think electromagnetic
forces are responsible in some way for these features, but no detailed theory
has been worked out. Pictures such as this and analyses of Voyager 2's spoke
movies may reveal more clues about the origins of these complex structures.
The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Pasadena, Calif.
