The Cassini Division and the A Ring

Outer A Ring in false color (from green, violet & ultraviolet frames).

Saturn's outer A Ring in false color, constructed from Voyager 2 green,
violet, and ultraviolet frames. The Cassini Division (lower right) is
distinctly less red than the A Ring. Also visible, as a sequence
of dark features in the outermost A Ring, is a series of orbital
resonances with Saturn's inner moons. The 325 km wide Encke Division
(upper left center) contains the tiny moon Pan. However, the cause of
the narrower Keeler Gap (closer to the outer edge of the A Ring) and the
gaps in the Cassini Division is not known.

The B and C Rings in False Color

Outer part of C Ring in blue and inner part of the B Ring in yellow.

The outer part of Saturn's C Ring (blue) and the inner part of the B
Ring (yellow) are shown here in false color. The color difference blurs
over the boundary between the rings.  The Maxwell Gap and its eccentric
ringlet, which appears yellow due to image mis-alignment, are in the
left center of this frame.

Chemistry of the Rings

Possible variations in chemical composition visible in false color image.

This highly enhanced false color view of Saturn's rings was assembled
from clear, orange and ultraviolet images. Possible variations in
chemical composition from one part of Saturn's ring system to another
are visible as subtle color variations.  In addition to the previously
known blue color of the C Ring and the Cassini Division, the picture
shows additional color differences (red-green) within and between the A
and B Rings.  The distance to Saturn was 8.9 million kilometers (5.5
million miles).

Spokes in the B Ring

Distinct pattern of "spokes" in the broad, bright, middle, B Ring.

Voyager 2 image 
<A HREF="/glossary.html#fds">FDS</A> 43643.34 
shows a distinct pattern of "spokes" in the B Ring, which is the broad,
bright, middle ring of Saturn's three main rings.  The spokes are made of
dust that has been raised off of the ring particles, but the reason the
spokes appear is unknown.

The Birth of a Spoke

Panels show appearance of small new spoke.

Contrast enhancement reveals numerous spokes in the B Ring.  In a
sequence of four Voyager 2 images (shown here as inset panels), a small
spoke is seen to appear in between several more prominent spokes.  The
arrow in the fourth inset image points to the new spoke.

Spokes in Forward-Scattered Light

Spoke appear as bright streak in forward-scattered light.

After passing Saturn, Voyager 2 viewed the B Ring in forward-scattered
light. The spokes, seen previously as dark streaks, are now seen as
bright streaks from this
<A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A>.
This indicates that the spokes are caused by tiny dust grains, comparable in
size to the wavelength of light.

Structure in the B Ring

Narrow ringlets make up the B Ring.

The B Ring is made up of narrow ringlets down to the limit of the image
resolution.  Some darker spokes are also visible.  The Cassini Division
is visible at upper right, and the A Ring is outside it; the C Ring is
visible at lower right.  This Voyager 2 image

Closeup of the B Ring

One of Voyager 2's closest looks at the B Ring from 743,000 km away.

This is one of Voyager 2's closest looks at the B Ring, from August 25,
1981 at a distance of 743,000 km.  The contrast has been enhanced to
show the fine structure.  The portion of the ring shown here is 6000 km
wide and features as narrow as 10 km are visible.

The Foreshortened Rings

The entire ring system shown very nearly edge-on and highly foreshortened.

The last image taken by Voyager 2 just before it crossed Saturn's ring
plane on August 26, 1981. The entire ring system is shown, but it is very
nearly edge-on and highly foreshortened.  The F Ring shows up prominently in
the foreground.

Dark Side of the Rings

The very thick B Ring lets through very little light.

This color-enhanced Voyager 2 image shows the unlit side of the rings.
Since the broad B Ring is very
<A HREF="/glossary.html#optical_depth">optically thick</A>,
very little light gets through so it appears very dark here.  The A and
C Rings let more light through so they appear brighter.  The unlit side
of the rings is rarely visible from Earth, except during the period of
ring plane crossings such as occurred in 1995.
