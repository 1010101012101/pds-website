**Caption: **

This view of Saturn's A ring was obtained Aug. 23, when Voyager 2 was about
2.8 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from the planet. Green, violet and
ultraviolet image of the ring, which images were used to compile this is
15,000 km. (9,300 mi.) wide. Of note here are the Cassini Division, in the
extreme lower right corner of this image; the Encke Division, the prominent
gap in the A ring, at upper left; and the inner F ring [shepherding
satellite](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) (1980S27), near the top of the
frame. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
