**Caption:**

This view of Saturn's A ring was obtained Aug. 23, when Voyager 2 was
 about 2.8 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) from the planet.
 Green, violet and ultraviolet image of the ring, which images were
 used to compile this is 15,000 km. (9,300 mi.) wide.  Of note here are
 the Cassini Division, in the extreme lower right corner of this image;
 the Encke Division, the prominent gap in the A ring, at upper left;
 and the inner F ring [shepherding satellite](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) (1980S27), near the top of
 the frame.  The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet
 Propulsion Laboratory.
