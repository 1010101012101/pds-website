**Caption:**

This Voyager 2 photograph of the lit face of Saturn's B ring was
 obtained Aug. 25 from a distance of 743,000 kilometers (461,000
 miles).  It covers a range of about 6,000 km. (3,700 mi.) and
 shows the ring structure broken up into about 10 times more
 ringlets than previously suspected.  The narrowest features here
 are about 15 km. (10 mi.) wide.  Variations in brightness are due
 to a combination of differences in ring particle number density
 and light scattering properties.  The B ring is the most opaque
 of Saturn's rings; the highest-resolution Voyager 1 observations
 were of its unlit face, where little detail is visible.  The
 Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
