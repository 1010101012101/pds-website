**Caption:**

After passing Saturn, Voyager 2 viewed the B Ring in forward-scattered light.
The spokes, seen previously as dark streaks, are now seen as bright streaks
from this [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle). This indicates that the
spokes are caused by tiny dust grains, comparable in size to the wavelength of
light.
