**Caption:**

The Cassini Division, separating Saturn's A and B Rings, is maintained by the
2:1 [resonance](/glossary.html#resonance) with Mimas. It was once thought to
be empty, but this closeup view, Voyager 2 image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds)
43989.46, shows that it really contains several broad belts of material
separated by empty "rifts".
