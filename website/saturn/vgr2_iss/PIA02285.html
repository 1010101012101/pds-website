**Caption:**

Voyager 2 returned this wide-angle, clear-filtered image of the shadow
 of Saturn upon the rings just after engineers at the Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory successfully commanded the camera platform to point to the
 planet. Problems with the plaform had prevented the spacecraft from
 returning photographs the past few days. This first picture after the
 repair was obtained the evening of Aug. 28, when Voyager 2 was 3.2
 million kilometers (2 million miles) from the planet and racing away at
 more than 26,000 mph. Saturn's nightside can be seen at upper left,
 with the shadow cast by the planet falling across the rings in the
 center of this image. The white lines, or "noise," across the
 photograph are the result of temporary ground communications troubles
 between the Australian Deep Space Network tracking station and Voyager
 mission control in Pasadena. The picture was received in Australia in
 perfect condition; the noise will be removed in subsequent processing.
 
 The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
 Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
