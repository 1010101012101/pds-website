**Caption: **

Voyager 2 image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 43643.34 shows a distinct pattern of
"spokes" in the B Ring, which is the broad, bright, middle ring of Saturn's
three main rings. The spokes are made of dust that has been raised off of the
ring particles, but the reason the spokes appear is unknown.
