**Caption:**

This wide-angle image of Saturn's rings was taken
 Aug. 26 just before Voyager 2's crossing of the plane of these complex
 structures. The spacecraft was 103,000 kilometers (64,000 miles) from the
 rings when it acquired this image. This extremely oblique view of the
 bright side of the rings highly magnifies features near the bottom of the
 picture and compresses features across to the other side of the west [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa)
 (the western edge of the loop in the rings). Starting from the bottom,
 one can see the F ring, the A ring with the Encke Gap, the Cassini
 Division (the narrow dark band at center), the B ring and the C ring. The
 high-contrast bright and dark areas of the C ring are seen at right; then,
 continuing upward, come the B and A rings straddling the Cassini
 Division and a very foreshortened view of the A ring. The bright streaks
 in the B ring are the spokes in forward-scattered light. The Voyager
 project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena,
 Calif.
