**Caption:**

This view focusing on Saturn's C ring (and to a lesser extent,
 the B ring at top and left) was compiled from three separate
 images taken through ultraviolet, clear and green filters.  On
 Aug. 23, when it acquired these frames, Voyager 2 was 2.7 million
 kilometers (1.7 million miles) from the planet.  More than 60
 bright and dark ringlets are evident here; the small, bland
 squares are caused by the removal of [reseau](/glossary.html#reseau) (reference) marks
 during processing.  In general, C ring material is very bland and
 gray, the color of dirty ice.  Color differences between this
 ring and the B ring indicate differing surface compositions for
 the material composing these complex structures.

 NASA's Office of Space Science.
