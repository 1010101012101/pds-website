**Caption: **

Possible variations in chemical composition from one part of Saturn's ring
system to another are visible in this Voyager 2 picture as subtle color
variations that can be recorded with special computer-processing techniques.
This highly enhanced color view was assembled from clear, orange and
ultraviolet frames obtained Aug. 17 from a distance of 8.9 million kilometers
(5.5 million miles). In addition to the previously known blue color of the C
ring and the Cassini Division, the picture shows additional color differences
between the inner B ring and outer region (where the spokes form) and between
these and the A ring. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
