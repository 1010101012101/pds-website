**Caption:**

Possible variations in chemical composition from one part of Saturn's
 ring system to another are visible in this Voyager 2 picture as subtle
 color variations that can be recorded with special computer-processing
 techniques.  This highly enhanced color view was assembled from clear,
 orange and ultraviolet frames obtained Aug. 17 from a distance of 8.9
 million kilometers (5.5 million miles).  In addition to the previously
 known blue color of the C ring and the Cassini Division, the picture
 shows additional color differences between the inner B ring and outer
 region (where the spokes form) and between these and the A ring.  The
 Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
 Pasadena, Calif.
