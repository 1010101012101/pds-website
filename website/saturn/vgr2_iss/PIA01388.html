**Caption:**

Voyager 2 took this picture of Saturn's faint inner D ring Aug.  25
 about 1 hour 48 minutes before the spacecraft's closest approach to
 Saturn.  The range was 195,400 kilometers (121,300 miles) and <A HREF="/glossary.html#phase_angle">phase angle</A> was 166`.  This view includes the sun's shadow across the ring.
 Voyager 1 saw this region in a similar view last fall, but this
 higher-resolution image shows many more ringlets and gaps.  The D ring
 is very tenuous and has an extremely small <A HREF="/glossary.html#optical_depth">optical depth</A>.  The Voyager
 project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
 Pasadena, Calif.
