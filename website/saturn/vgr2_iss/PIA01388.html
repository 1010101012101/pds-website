**Caption: **

Voyager 2 took this picture of Saturn's faint inner D ring Aug. 25 about 1
hour 48 minutes before the spacecraft's closest approach to Saturn. The range
was 195,400 kilometers (121,300 miles) and [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) was 166`. This view includes the sun's
shadow across the ring. Voyager 1 saw this region in a similar view last fall,
but this higher-resolution image shows many more ringlets and gaps. The D ring
is very tenuous and has an extremely small [optical
depth](/glossary.html#optical_depth). The Voyager project is managed for NASA
by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
