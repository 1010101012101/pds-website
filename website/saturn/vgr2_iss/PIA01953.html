**Caption:**

The outer edge of Saturn's A ring is detailed in this image obtained
 by Voyager 2 on Aug. 26, just half an hour before closest approach, at
 a range of about 51,000 kilometers (31,700 miles).  Resolution in this
 wide-angle view is about 4 km. (2.5 miles).  The many sharp linear
 features parallel to the ring edge are most probably locations where
 ring particles are in [resonance](/glossary.html#resonance) with one of the several small nearby
 satellites of about 100-km.  radius discovered last fall by Voyager 1.
 Such regions are likely characterized by more intense particle
 collisions and a greater density of small "chips."  The entire outer
 band of the A ring has different scattering properties and therefore
 different particle characteristics than the main body of the rings to
 the upper left.  The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet
 Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
