Image [FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 44006.49 shows the F Ring
[ansa](/glossary.html#ansa) just before Voyager 2 passed through the ring
plane on August 26, 1981. The F Ring seems to be made up of a number of
separate strands. In addition, the whole region inside the F Ring is not
black, indicating that it is filled with fine dust.
