**Caption: **

This composite image shows two views of the outer edge of Saturn's B ring
(left) and the inner part of the Cassini Division (right) in the rings. The
images were taken on opposite sides of the planet Aug. 25 from a range of
610,000 kilometers (380,000 miles). The dramatic result of this comparison is
that the thin eccentric ringlet in the inner gap of the Cassini Division is
shown not to match from side to side; moreover, the edge of the B ring differs
by about 50 km. (30 mi.) as well. Scientists believe the distorted shape of
the B ring edge is due to the gravitational influence of the Saturnian
satellite Mimas. It is noted, too, that much of the fine B ring structure also
mismatches from side to side, possibly indicating that they are wave
phenomena. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propuslion
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
