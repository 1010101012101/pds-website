**Caption:**

This composite image shows two views of the outer edge of
 Saturn's B ring (left) and the inner part of the Cassini Division
 (right) in the rings.  The images were taken on opposite sides of
 the planet Aug. 25 from a range of 610,000 kilometers (380,000
 miles).  The dramatic result of this comparison is that the thin
 eccentric ringlet in the inner gap of the Cassini Division is
 shown not to match from side to side; moreover, the edge of the
 B ring differs by about 50 km. (30 mi.) as well.  Scientists
 believe the distorted shape of the B ring edge is due to the
 gravitational influence of the Saturnian satellite Mimas.  It is
 noted, too, that much of the fine B ring structure also
 mismatches from side to side, possibly indicating that they are
 wave phenomena.  The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the
 Jet Propuslion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
