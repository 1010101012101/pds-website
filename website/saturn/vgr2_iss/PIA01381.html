**Caption: **

Voyager 2 discovered a new "kinky" ringlet inside the Encke Gap in Saturn's A
ring. These pictures show the thin ringlet at two different positions,
photographed Aug. 25 from a distance of about 700,000 kilometers (435,000
miles) near the time the spacecraft crossed the planet's ring plane.
Resolution is about 15 km. (9 mi.) in both frames. Here, the ringlet appears
in two different positions: about midway in the gap in the right-hand image
and near the inner edge of the gap at left. Scientists do not know if the
kinky ring is eccentric, or off-center, or if perhaps there are several inner
rings, with different components visible at different longitudes. The kinks,
clearly visible on the right, appear to be more closely spaced than those seen
in Saturn's outer F ring. (The fine white dots or "snow" in these pictures are
artifacts of processing and are not individual moonlets). The Voyager project
is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
