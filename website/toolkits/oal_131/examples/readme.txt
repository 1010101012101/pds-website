The examples directory contains example programs written in C, IDL and
Fortran.

Use the Makefile in the source directory to compile and link the C
versions on UNIX platforms.

The PDS label and data files V1.LBL, SGC_0031.LBL and SGC_0031.DAT must
be in the directory the programs are run from.  These files are
available for transfer from the pub/oal directory of the release:
transfer V1.LBL and SGC_0031.DAT in binary (image) mode, and transfer
SGC_0031.LBL in ASCII mode.


NOTE: As of September 2003, the aforementioned example files cannot
be located. We apologize for the inconvenience. The sample programs
can still be adapted for use with other PDS data files.
