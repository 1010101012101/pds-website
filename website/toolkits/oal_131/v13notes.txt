                    PDS Object Access Library
                    -------------------------

                  Version 1.3 Release, Mar 1998

The Version 1.3 release of the PDS Object Access Library and Label Library
Lite is now available via anonymous ftp from miranda.Colorado.edu
(128.138.137.33) in pub/oal.
The file oal.tar.Z takes about 3 Mbytes when uncompressed and un-tarred.
It contains OAL and L3 source code,  Makefiles for UNIX platforms, example
programs, the OAL User's Guide in postscript and pdf formats and the L3
User's Guide.

New in this release are:

OAL:
- Added support for BIL format Qubes and removed previous limitations on
  Qubes with suffixes.
- Added support for GIF files: an ODL tree for a GIF file is created
  on-the-fly by OaParseLabelFile, and OaReadImage can now read images
  whose ENCODING_TYPE = GIF.  See specific documentation in OaGif.txt
  The file oa_gif.c should be added to your Makefile.
- Bug fixes.

L3:
- Added functions to get and set comment fields and filename field in
  OBJDESC and KEYWORD structures.
- Added functions to aid writing of labels when the user wants portions
  of the ODL tree (^STRUCTURE and ^CATALOG inclusions) to be written to
  separate files:  OdlChangeExpansionFile, OdlExtractExpansionTree,
  updates to OdlPrintLabel.
- Updated L3_UsersGuide.txt
