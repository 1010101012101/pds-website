# Rings Node Toolkits

These toolkits are no longer maintained and may in some cases no longer
compile without modification.

This is a set of downloadable software tools developed at the PDS Rings Node.
They enable users to perform a variety of common tasks related to planning
ring observations, analyzing data, or carrying out dynamical calculations.
Tools are generally written in standard C, and are callable from programs
written in either C or FORTRAN-77.

Software toolkits are provided in zip, tar and gzip formats. They have been
tested on workstations running Unix and VMS, but are likely to run on other
platforms with only minimal modifications. They come with complete build
instructions and scripts.

## Kepler Library

A set of routines for performing calculations related to orbital motion around
an oblate planet. Routines can be used to predict satellite locations and to
calculate arbitrary resonance locations in planetary rings.

  * Read the [AAREADME](kepler_102/aareadme.txt) file for more information. 
  * [Browse](kepler_102/) the delivery package including source code. 
  * Go to the [software order form](order.html). (It's free!) 

## Julian Library

A set of routines for manipulating dates and times. It includes routines for
conversions between Universal Time (UTC), Atomic Time (TAI), and Ephemeris
Time (ET). It also performs conversions between calendar dates and Julian
dates, and interprets or formats dates and times in a variety of styles.

## Profile Library

A set of object-oriented routines for manipulating ring occultation data sets.
Tools are provided for reading PDS-labeled data files, applying geometry and
calibration models, filtering and resampling. The toolkit supports all
occultation data archived by the Rings Node.

This toolkit is built upon the PDS's Object Access Library (OAL). You can
download the latest version from the [PDS Central
Node](http://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/software_download.cfm) but we recommend
you use version 1.3.1, as optimized by the Rings Node for this toolkit.

  * [Browse](profile_13/) the delivery package including source code. 
  * Read the [AAREADME](oal_131/aareadme.txt) file for the Object Access Library. 
  * Download the [OAL Users' Guide](oal_131/oalguide.pdf) (PDF format). 
  * [Browse](oal_131/) the OAL delivery package.
