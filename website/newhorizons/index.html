# Welcome to the Rings Node's New Horizons at Jupiter Information Page

##  Introduction

**Supporting SPICE files from the Jupiter encounter are no longer maintained at the Rings Node.** These files are available from the PDS NAIF Node. 

The New Horizons mission obtained data using a variety of instruments during
the Jupiter encounter and for approximately 90 days following Jupiter closest
approach. The bulk of the rings relevant New Horizons data was obtained by the
LOng Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), a high resolution optical camera.

While all of the New Horizons data are available from the [PDS Small Bodies
Node (SBN)](http://pds-
smallbodies.astro.umd.edu/data_sb/missions/newhorizons/index.shtml), the Rings
Node maintains duplicate copies of all of the LORRI data. The raw data is
provided in a single volume while the same data in calibrated form is divided
into three volumes.

##  Key Documents

The information contained in the SOC Instrument Interface Control Document
(ICD), and in the documents submitted for publication in Space Science Reviews
(SSR) in 2007, is crucial to understanding the data in this archive. As such,
the producers of this archive have included the best possible versions of
these documents in the DOCUMENT subdirectory of each volume.

As a minimum, users of the LORRI data should review the following documents:

  * [AAREADME](nh_AAREADME.TXT). Provides an overview of the data set.
  * [ICD](SOC_INST_ICD.PDF). Contains general information and details of the LORRI instrument and data.
  * [LORRI SSR](LORRI_SSR.PDF)The LORRI article submitted to SSR.

For information on the geometry data included in the labels and metadata, see
the

  * [quaternion description](QUAT_AXYZ_J2K_TO_INSTR.ASC) file and its associated [label file.](QUAT_AXYZ_J2K_TO_INSTR.LBL)

The meta data provided in the original INDEX.TAB files is very limited. We
have produced a single, expanded index file covering the entire calibrated
data set.

  * [expanded index](nhjulo_newindex.tab) file and its associated [label file.](nhjulo_newindex.lbl)

## Ring Observation "Tour Guide"

Mark Showalter has assembled a table of all the ring observations, including a
brief description of the targeting and the science goals.

  * PDS-formatted table: [lorri_jring_images.tab](lorri_jring_images.tab)
  * PDS3 label: [lorri_jring_images.lbl](lorri_jring_images.lbl)
  * Zip file of all the diagrams: [lorri_jring_image_diagrams.zip](lorri_jring_image_diagrams.zip)

##  All of the LORRI data can be accessed directly from the table below.

We also provide browse images for all of the LORRI observations.

  * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume. 

  * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column. 

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/targzip.htm).

  * Browse images for the calibrated files can be viewed by following the "Browse Images" link for that volume.

## New Horizons Links

In additon to the Rings Node, geometry data is available from the

PDS NAIF Node.  and New Horizons information web pages are available from the

  * [Atmospheres Node](http://atmos.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/NewHorizons/NH_Jupiter.html)
  * [Small Bodies Node (SBN)](http://pds-smallbodies.astro.umd.edu/data_sb/missions/newhorizons/index.shtml)

Information on the spacecraft and its instruments is available from the New
Horizons Mission [Home page](http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/).
