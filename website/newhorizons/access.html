##  Accessing New Horizons Data

**Search as of 4/16/2017**

  * Searches of the LORRI and MVIC data are supported in [OPUS](/search#/missionid=New+Horizons&view=search&browse=gallery&colls_browse=gallery&page=1&gallery_data_viewer=true&limit=100&order=time1&cols=ringobsid,planet,target,phase1,phase2,time1,time2&widgets=missionid,instrumentid,planet,target&widgets2=&detail=). 
  * LORRI data search parameters include enhanced geometric parameters for which values have been generated by the RMS node. 
  * We plan to generate and incorporate into OPUS enhanced geometric metadata for MVIC in the near future.

### Getting the Data You Want

The table below contains links to, all of the available LORRI and MVIC data volumes from 
post launch cruise, the Jupiter encounter, Pluto cruise, and the Pluto encounter.

  * **Review** a volume on-line by clicking the volume ID. 

  * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second table. 

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.

  * **Browse** will take you to a directory containing sub-directories of preview images for each data product in the volume. 
  
    * MVIC produces images that are extremely wide strips. Full-resolution browse images use each image's native proportions. Smaller "thumbnail" previews have been generated by wrapping each strip left-to-right and top-to-bottom, like text on a page. This makes it easier to see the entire content of each image clearly in a smaller amount of screen space. Previews are color-coded to indicate the wavelength band, blue for the shortest wavelength through deepest red for the IR and methane filters.
   
  * **Extended Index** will take you to the extended index of metadata for the volume. 

  * **Geometry Index** will take you to the index of enhanced geometric metadata for the volume.  

  * **Open Liens** Many of the New Horizons volumes are still in "Liens Resolution". For those volumes the peer review panel found issues which 
   must be resolved before the data set can be archived. However, none of the liens are significant enough to preclude PDS Certification 
   and release for use in R&A proposals. These data sets are identified in the table by an entry in the "Open Liens" column.
   
  * There are a total of three files which between them cover all of the open liens for the data associated with this page:
  
    * Liens for <a href="nhlo_la-ju-pc_liens.txt" target="_blank">LORRI, raw and calibrated for the Post Launch, Jupiter, and Pluto Cruise phases</a>
   
    * Liens for <a href="nhpelo_liens.txt" target="_blank">LORRI, raw and calibrated Pluto Encounter</a>
  
    * Liens for <a href="nhpemv_liens.txt" target="_blank">MVIC, raw and calibrated Pluto Encounter</a>


### Available Volumes

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.
