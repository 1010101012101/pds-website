##  Accessing New Horizons Data

**Search as of 9/2/2016**

  * Searches of the LORRI data are supported in [OPUS](/search/). 
  * This capability will be extended to the MVIC data shortly.
  * LORRI data searches will shortly include enhanced geometric parameters for which values have been generated by the RMS node. 
  * We plan to generate and incorporate into OPUS enhanced geometric metadata for MVIC in the near future.

### Getting the Data You Want

The table below contains links to, all of the available LORRI and MVIC data volumes from 
post launch cruise, the Jupiter encounter, Pluto cruise, and the Pluto encounter.

  * **Review** a volume on-line by clicking the volume ID. 

  * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second table. 

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/targzip.htm).

  * **Browse** will take you to a directory containing sub-directories of preview images for each data product in the volume. 

  * **Extended Index** will take you to the extended index of metadata for the volume. 

  * **Geometry Index** will take you to the index of enhanced geometric metadata for the volume.  

** Many of the New Horizons volumes are still in "Liens Resolution". For those volumes the peer review panel found issues which 
   must be resolved before the data set can be archived. However, none of the liens are significant enough to preclude PDS Certification 
   and release for use in R&A proposals. These data sets are identified in the table by an entry in the "Open Liens" column.**
   
  * **Open Liens** will take you to a file containing the liens for the specific data set. 


### Available Volumes

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.
