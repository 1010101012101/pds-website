## Welcome to the Rings Node's ROSES 2009 NRA Support Page

### Introduction

This page is intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in the
ROSES 2009 NRA.

The full document can be accessed under **Solicitations** at the [NSPIRES web
site.](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

###  The Rings Related Research Programs

The tabs associated with this page identify PDS nodes with data holdings
relevant to each of the indicated programs, provide links to relevant pages
within the PDS, and access to the data.

Since several of the programs include encouragement or requirements to archive
the results of the proposed research, the last tab gives information and links
to assist with archive planning and incorporating archive planning in
proposals.

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRAs supported by
these pages based on announced updates to ROSES 2009 Through September 4,
2009. The links are to the respective Rings Node support pages (same
destinations as the tabs at the top of the page).

Program | Appendix | NOI Due | Proposal Due  
---|---|---|---  
[Cassini DAP (CDAP)](cdap_2009.html) | C.10 | 4/3/09 | 5/1/09  
[Outer Planets Research (OPR)](opr_2009.html) | C.7 | 8/28/09 | 12/18/09  
Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PG&amp;G;)* | C.4 | 4/3/09 | 5/15/09  
[Planetary Mission DAP (PMDAP)**](pmdap_2009.html) | C.11 | 6/5/09 | 8/14/09  
  
* **PG&amp;G;**. _For rings studies_, planetary spacecraft mission data sources eligible for PG&amp;G;, are the same as those eligible for the OPR NRA except for PG&amp;G;, planetary spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or other publicly accessible archives **at the time of the release of the NRA**. Please see our [OPR](opr_2009.html) support page for information about, and links to, available data. 

** **PMDAP**. While most opportunities for rings specific data analysis are covered by the programs addressed in the tabs to this page, PMDAP affords a unique opportunity for ring scientists to propose for the restoration of publically available data sets. Individuals or teams interested in pursuing this opportunity should [ contact us](/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?) early for assistence in identifying and obtaining eligible data, and in determining the PDS compliance requirements for the completed deliverables.
