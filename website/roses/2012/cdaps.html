<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

 <b><p>Step-1 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3/23/2012</p>
    <p>Step-2 Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/4/2012 </p>

</ul>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p> The Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists Program (CDAPS) 
      is described in Appendix C.10 of the ROSES 2012 NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the 
    <a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

 <p> In the Clarifications and Corrections as of February 27, 2012: The 
  limit on the number of Step-1 proposals per P.I. was removed
</p>

 <p>
 <p>The specific data restrictions given for the 2012 
    CDAPS are: 
 </p> 
 
  <ul> 
        
  <p>Proposals must be focused on the Saturn system and make 
   significant use of (or greatly enhance the use of) data 
   returned by Cassini instruments. Proposals to work with Cassini 
   data and also use ground-based or other data are acceptable, 
   provided that the success of the proposal, as written, is 
   dependent upon the Cassini data. 
  </p>
 
  <p>In the first two years of the CDAPS program data from the 
   Cassini Jupiter flyby in 2000 were eligible. This is no longer 
   true. Proposals that address Jupiter data should be directed to 
   the Outer Planets Research program described in Appendix C.7 of 
   this ROSES NRA.
  </p>
  
   <p>In order to be considered under the data analysis portion of 
    the call, proposing PIs <b>must use data that are in the 
    public domain 90 days before the CDAPS Step 2 proposals due 
    date</b> (Henry Throop private communication), and they must 
    make clear to the peer reviewers that the data are publicly 
    available. Proposals that do not comply with this rule may be 
    declared noncompliant and declined without evaluation. It is 
    understood, however, that once the grant is awarded, 
    succeeding years of work may address data that have 
    subsequently come into the archive. 
   </p>  
  
   <p>Whether from the PDS or another source, if the data to be 
    analyzed is not certified or otherwise has issues that might 
    represent an obstacle to analysis, the proposers must clearly 
    demonstrate that such potential difficulties can be overcome. 
   </p>
  </ul>

 <p><b> Volumes at the Rings Node</b> which meet the CDAPS basic 
  eligibility requirements for publicly available timing (based on 
  the Step 2 Proposal due date)and PDS certification are listed 
  below. 
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>COCIRS_0401 through COCIRS_1103</li>
   <li>COCIRS_5401 through COCIRS_6006</li>
   <li>COISS_0001 through COISS_0011</li>
   <li>COISS_2001 through COISS_2067</li>
   <li>COISS_3001 through COISS_3007</li>
   <li>COUVIS_0004 through COUVIS_0034</li>
   <li>COVIMS_0004 through COVIMS_0046</li>
 </ul>

<p>In addition, Volumes <b>at the Rings Node</b> which meet the CDAPS 
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing but which 
  <b>have not</b> yet been certified by PDS are: 
</p>
 <ul>
    <li>COUVIS_8001</li>
 </ul>
</ul>
 
<h3>Finding Cassini Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Rings Node.</b>

 <ul>
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
  <p> <a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of 
   data based on a wide range of constraints. At this time the the 
   tool's support for Cassini data is limited to CIRS, ISS and 
   VIMS. The results returned include preview products for all 
   three instruments. </p>
   
  <p> We continue extend the scope of OPUS and 
   hope to include UVIS data before the end of FY12. </p>
   
  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/vol/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/archives/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

    <li><b> Use our Cassini Information Pages</b></li>
  <p> Our <a href="/cassini/">Cassini information pages</a> provide tabular links to the data organized by observation date
    for each instrument, links to Rings Node generated preview images (ISS and VIMS) and footprint diagrams (CIRS). 
    These pages also provide overviews of the CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS instruments and their associated documentation.

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.
