<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<img  alt="[SPACER]" align="LEFT" width=4  height=70 src="css/spacer.gif"> 

<p> The Outer Planets Research (OPR) program is described in Appendix C.7 of the NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the 
    <a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

<p>The specific data availability restrictions given for the 2012 OPR are:
</p>

 <ul>

   <p> "It is the responsibility of the investigators selected for 
   this program to acquire any needed data. Therefore, before 
   submitting a proposal, the investigator must determine that all 
   data required for the proposed investigation are publicly 
   available <b>[by the proposal due date]</b>. Proposals requiring 
    the use of data that are not 
   publicly available at the time of proposal submission may be 
   rejected without review."
 </p>

 <p> "Proposals dealing with mission data should provide convincing evidence 
  that currently available public data has sufficient quality and is 
  available in sufficient quantity to achieve the goals set forth in 
  the proposal."
 </p>
 </ul>

<p> <b> AS of 10/16/2012, volumes at the Rings Node</b> which meet the 
  OPR basic eligibility requirements for <b>publicly available timing and 
  PDS certification</b> are listed below. </p>

<p>* <b>NOTE:</b> After peer review lien resolution of the data set of 
       processed images from the Voyager Saturn encounters, we reorganized 
       and renumbered the volumes. The data has not been altered. 
       The original PDS certified date remains valid, and these volumes remain 
       eligible for the 2012 OPR call. The new volume numbers, VGISS_61xx for 
       Voyager 1 at Saturn, VGISS_62xx for Voyager 2 at Saturn contain all of
       the data previously in VGISS_04, VGISS_05, and VGISS_26 through VGISS_38.

<p>In addition, the following Volumes <b>at the Rings Node</b> meet the OPR 
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing, but <b>are not

  for some proposals it may be possible to demonstrate that the "...data has 
  sufficient quality and is available in sufficient quantity to achieve the 
  goals set forth in the proposal."

<p> Proposers considering using any of the following should

<h3>Finding OPR Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<img  alt="[SPACER]" align="LEFT" width=4  height=10 src="css/spacer.gif"> 

<b> Data at the Rings Node.</b>

 <ul> 
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
   <p><a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of 
   data based on a wide range of constraints. At this time the the 
   tool supports Cassini CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons 
   Jupiter LORRI data, Galileo SSI data, and Voyager ISS data. 
   The results returned include preview products and tables of meta-data.</p>


  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/vol/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/archives/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  
    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>
    
 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with 
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data 
    and to Rings Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>
  
  <ul> 
   <p><li><a href="/cassini">Cassini </a> Our Cassini mission pages support CIRS, 
    ISS, UVIS, and VIMS. <b>Now include links to updated geometric metadata
        for the four instruments</b>.</li>
   </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the 
     Small Bodies Node.</li>
    </p>
                 
  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State 
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages 
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated 
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data 
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the 
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Rings Node.</li>
  </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While 
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary 
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently 
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at 
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will 
   reflect it. </li>

<b> Data available at other PDS nodes.</b>
 <ul>  
  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles. 
   </p>

 <li>Start with the 
    <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>. 
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more 
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
