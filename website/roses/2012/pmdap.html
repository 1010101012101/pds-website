<h2>Critical Dates</h2>
<ul>
 <b><p>Notice of Intent due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8/17/2012</p>

 <p> The Planetary Mission Data Analysis Program (PMDAP) is 
   described in Appendix C.11 of the NRA. The full document 
   can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the <a 
   href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web 
   site.</a> </p> 
   
 <p> There are two distinct aspects to the PMDAP AO - Data Analysis 
    and Data Restoration. The criteria for the eligibilty of data are 
    significantly different for the two aspects.

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<ul>
    
 <p>The broad data availability restrictions given for the 2012 
    PMDAP <b> for data analysis </b> are:  </p>
   
   <p>"The PMDAP supports scientific investigations that use only 
   data available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) 
   (http://pds.nasa.gov/) or other publicly accessible archive(s), 
   such as planetary data in the NASA astrophysics data archives. 
   The data must be archived and <publicly available 30 days prior 
   to the submission deadline</b> for PMDAP proposals. Spacecraft 
   data that have not been placed in such archives may not be 
   proposed for use in PMDAP investigations."</p>
    
   <p>"Data products accessible in the PDS must be designated 
   “certified” (ready for scientific use) in order to be eligible 
   for the PMDAP (see Appendix C.1). Data products accessible in 
   archives other than the PDS that are still in liens resolution 
   are not considered archived and their analysis will not be 
   supported by the PMDAP."<p>    

 <p>"The PMDAP is not intended to overlap other active data analysis 
  programs. Thus the PMDAP does not support the analysis of:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Lunar data</li>
     <li>Mars data obtained by missions to Mars</li> 
     <li>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune system phenomena</li> 
     <li>Data from Cassini</li>
     <li>Data from the New Horizons, Galileo, Voyager, Pioneer, and Ulysses missions"</li>
  </ul>
</p>
</ul>  
 <p> While there are some exceptions to these restrictions (e.g., 
    Galileo asteroid flyby data), all of the data at the Rings Node falls 
    under one or more of the above exclusions. </p>

</ul>
<h2>Data restoration</h2>
<ul>
<p> PMDAP affords a unique opportunity for ring scientists to propose for the restoration of
    publicly available data sets. Individuals or teams interested in pursuing this opportunity should
    <a href="/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?"> contact us</a> early for assistance in identifying and obtaining eligible data, 
    or determining the PDS compliance requirements for the completed deliverables.
</P>
<p> Additional information regarding preparing data for the PDS is available through the
    <a href="archiving_2012.html">Archiving</a> tab.
