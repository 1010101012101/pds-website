## Welcome to the Rings Node's ROSES 2011 NRA Support Pages

![\[SPACER\]](css/spacer.gif)

### Introduction

These pages are intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in
the ROSES 2011 NRA.

Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at the PDS
Engineering Node's [ ROSES support](http://pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml)
page.

The full ROSES document can be accessed under **Solicitations** at the
[NSPIRES web site.](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

###  The Rings Related Research Programs

![\[SPACER\]](css/spacer.gif)

ROSES NRA's include specific requirements concerning the public availability
and quality of data intended for use in proposed research. To assist
proposers, we identify the availability date and status of each of the data
sets or data volumes in the Rings Node holdings on the "Data Status" tab.

Since several of the programs include encouragement or requirements to archive
the results of the proposed research, the "Archiving" tab provides information
and links to assist with archive planning and incorporating archive planning
in proposals.

The other tabs associated with this page provide information on data at the
the Rings Node relevant to the specific NRA identified in the tab name, and
links to holdings at other PDS nodes which also may be relevant.

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRA's supported by
these pages based on the initial release of ROSES 2011, February 18, 2011. We
will attempt to keep these pages current as relevant amendments to ROSES 2011
are released. However, the definitive source is of course the [NSPIRES web
site.](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

The links in the following table are to the respective Rings Node support
pages (same destinations as the tabs at the top of the page).

Program | Appendix | NOI Due | Proposal Due  
---|---|---|---  
[Cassini Data Analysis and Participating Scientists
Program(CDAPS)](cdaps.html) | C.10 | 6/10/11 | 7/08/11  
[Outer Planets Research (OPR)](opr.html) | C.7 | 8/26/11 | 11/04/11  
Planetary Geology and Geophysics (PG&amp;G;)* | C.4 | 4/29/11 | 6/3/11  
[Planetary Mission DAP (PMDAP)**](pmdap.html) | C.11 | 8/19/11 | 10/14/11  
  
* **PG&amp;G;**. _For rings studies_, planetary spacecraft mission data sources eligible for PG&amp;G;, are the same as those eligible for the CDAPS & OPR NRA's except for the data availability cut off dates. For PG&amp;G;, "Planetary spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations must be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or similar publicly accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the PGG proposal submission date." Please see our [CDAPS](cdaps.html) and [OPR](opr.html) support pages for information about, and links to, available data within the PDS. 

** **PMDAP**. While most opportunities for rings specific data analysis are covered by the other programs addressed in these pages, PMDAP affords a unique opportunity for ring scientists to propose for the restoration of publicly available data sets. Individuals or teams interested in pursuing this opportunity should [ contact us](/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?) early for assistance in identifying and obtaining eligible data, and in determining the PDS compliance requirements for the completed deliverables.
