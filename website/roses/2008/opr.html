<h2>Critical Dates</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>Notice of Intent due date:</b>  8/29/2008  
    <b>Revised proposal due date:</b> 11/14/2008 (extended due to hurricane Ike). </p>
</ul>


<h2>Data Sources Permitted Under the NRA</h2>

<p><b> Note - Mission data eligible for rings specific proposals to 
    the Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program are the same as for OPR 
    (New Horizons, Cassini, Galileo, Voyager, Pioneer, and Ulysses 
    missions). The links to those data given on this page effectively 
    support both OPR & PG&G (although PG&G has a much earlier data availability 
cut off date than OPR).</b>

<p> The <a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={E529A93E-C05F-7B1E-680D-D5C7488C2F6C}&path=open">ROSES 2008</a> 
    Outer Planets Research Program (OPR) 
    <a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId=%7B4B0D53ED-E675-B1C8-7630-35660F8B7A48%7D&path=open">Appendix C.7</a>, specifies that:
</p>

<p> "The use of flight mission data in proposed investigations is 
limited to the New Horizons, Cassini, Galileo, Voyager, Pioneer, and Ulysses 
missions. However, investigators proposing cometary research may 
also use data from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) 
mission. Proposals requiring the use of data that are not publicly 
available at the time of proposal submission may be rejected 
without review."</p>

<ul><li>Mission data (including some SOHO data) are available from 
    the PDS. This page provides information to help proposers find 
    that data and supporting documentation.</li></ul>

<p>"... investigators who wish to pursue further analysis of 
existing ground observations of asteroids, comets, giant planets, 
outer planet satellites, rings, and Kuiper Belt objects are 
encouraged to apply to the OPR program ..."</p>

<ul><li>The PDS archives some ground based observational data that 
   may be relevant. However, <b>not all ground based observational data 
   archived by the PDS satisfies the criteria for elligibility specified 
   in the OPR NRA.</b> This page does not address PDS ground based data holdings. Users 
   are encouraged to contact directly the appropriate PDS Discipline 
   Node For assistance.</li></ul>

<ul><li>"Proposals requiring the use of data that are not publicly available at 
    the time of proposal submission may be rejected without review."
</ul>

<h2>Finding OPR Relevant Data within the PDS</h2>
<ul>
<h3> SPICE Data </h3>
    
    <p>The primary source of SPICE data for these missions is NAIF's 
    <a href="ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/">anonymous FTP site</a>.
</P>
<p>Additionally, the Rings Node is generating complete SPICE C kernels for
    the Voyager encounters. Links to the currently available kernels are 
included on our Voyager page.</p>
    
<h3> Data at the Rings Node.</h3>

 <ul>  
        <p> The beta version of our <a href="/search/">Multi-Mission Search Tool</a> allows
   a user to search for and obtain subsets of data based on a wide range of constraints. At this time 
   the the tool's support is limited to Cassini ISS at Jupiter, and at Saturn to Cassini ISS & CIRS and 
   Voyager ISS. We plan to continue extending the scope of the tool to address all of the data held 
   at the Rings Node.</p>

 <li><a href="cdap.html">Cassini </a> This link is to the Rings Node's 
    Cassini DAP web page. The links to the data are the same for both 
    NRAs; although the eligibility cut off date for data ("available 
  to the public") is later for the OPR NRA.</li>

 <li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. This links to the rings node's New Horizon page
     which provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and support files, 
                 plus links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the 
                 Small Bodies Node.</li>
 <li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a> </li>
 <li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> </li>
 <li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While publicly available URPX 
                observations obtained under Planetary Astronmy Program are covered by this 
                NRA, we do not currently have any such data. If elegible URPX data becomes 
                available at the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will reflect it. </li>
</ul>

<h3> Data available at other PDS nodes.</h3>
 <ul>  
 <li>Start with the 
    <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/data_services/search_services.html">PDS wide search engine</a>. 
    Use this service to identify the discipline nodes holding 
    data relative to your proposal. Visiting those nodes' home pages 
    should lead you to more detailed information. </li>
