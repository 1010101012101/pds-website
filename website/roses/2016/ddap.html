<p>The Discovery Data Analysis Program (DDAP) is described in Appendix C.11 of the ROSES 2016 NRA, and amendment 1.

<h3>Archiving Considerations</h3>

 <p>
 <p>While no Discovery DAP supported data is archived with the Ring-Moon Systems Node, this node may be a suitable site
 	for archiving data produced as a result of analysis of Kepler/K2 solar system observations. If you think this may be the case for
 	data you intend to produce, early in your proposal development
 	<a href="/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?">contact us.</a>.
 </p>
 <p>On July 26, 2016 a change was made to the wording in section C.1 of ROSES 2016 which affects DDAP proposals:
 	"Proposers intending to archive data or products in the PDS must obtain and include confirmation, in the form of a letter of support from the appropriate Discipline Node, that the PDS is willing to accept their submission."
