## Welcome to the Ring-Moon Systems Node's ROSES 2016 NRA Support Pages

**Last updated: 10/14/2016, through Amendment 38.**

### Introduction

These pages are intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in
the <a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={68C12087-132D-3814-9A87-5323BCE6CAB6}&path=open" target="_blank">ROSES 2016 NRA</a>.

Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at the PDS
Engineering Node's <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml" target="_blank">ROSES support</a>
page.

The "Data Status" tab provides the availability date and "PDS Certification"
status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Ring-Moon Systems Node holdings.
The other tabs associated with this page provide information on data at the
Ring-Moon Systems Node relevant to the specific AO identified in the tab name.

The "Help for Proposers" tab provides some general information regarding proposals which include submitting data to PDS (e.g., information relevant to developing the required Data Management Plan).

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRA's supported by
these pages based on ROSES 2016. We will attempt to keep these pages current
as relevant amendments to ROSES 2016 are released. However, the definitive
source is of course the <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/" target="_blank">NSPIRES web
site.</a>
