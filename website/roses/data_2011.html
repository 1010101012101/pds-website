## Status and Availability dates

### Introduction

The following table lists data held at the PDS Rings Node, generally by Volume
or Dataset ID, the date the data became publicly available, it's PDS
certification status, and the date the volume was certified.

  * **Dates**

In order to reduce the size of the table, all data available on or before
January 1st, 2012 are show as available on 2012-01-01. For example, this
allows us to group all 67 volumes of Cassini ISS Saturn data submitted between
Jul 1st, 2005 and January 1st, 2012 on a single line. Certification date is
handled in the same fashion.

  * **PDS Certification**

Data sets that are appropriate for inclusion in NASA data analysis and other
proposals are those that have successfully completed the PDS peer review
process, or are about to pass, pending resolution of minor liens that the
review panel and relevant PDS Node deem not to impact the scientific integrity
of the data set. These data sets are considered "certified" by the PDS. Data
sets (or newly delivered, non-reviewed increments to dynamic data sets within
archives) that do not meet the above criteria are considered "non-certified"
and are clearly labeled as such on PDS web sites.
