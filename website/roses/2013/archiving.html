<h2>Advice on Archive Planning and Preparation</h2>

<p>Proposers are encouraged to contact early a member of staff from 
    a discipline node most closely associated with your planned research. 
    <b>The staffs at the discipline nodes are your best sources for all 
        aspects of archive planning and preparation</b>.

        <li><a href="//pds.nasa.gov/contact/contact.shtml">Contact information</a> 
        for all of the nodes.</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Planning Documents</h2>

<p>The PDS offers tutorials designed to assist with the early stages 
    of archive planning. Although both are written primarily from a mission perspective, 
    the information they contain is also relevant to proposers to NRAs.
