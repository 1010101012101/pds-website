<h3>Critical Dates</h3>
<ul>
 <b><p>Notice of Intent due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/3/13</p>
    <p>Proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6/14/13</p>
    <p>Data Availability date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5/15/13</b> </p>
</ul>

<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<p> The Planetary Geology and Geophysics Research (PGG) program is described 
      in Appendix C.4 of the NRA and ROSES-13 Amendment 4 (3/1/13). 
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the 
    <a href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

     
<p>The specific data availability restrictions given for the 2013 PGG are:
</p>

 <ul>

   <p> "Planetary spacecraft mission data to be used in proposed investigations 
    must be available in the Planetary Data System (PDS) or equivalent publicly 
    accessible archive at least 30 days prior to the PGG proposal submission date. 
    Spacecraft data that have not been obtained (i.e., future mission data), or 
    those that have not been placed in approved archives are not eligible for 
    use in PGG investigations. <b>Whether from the PDS or equivalent archive, if 
    the data to be analyzed are not certified for scientific use, are not free of 
    liens, or otherwise have issues that might represent an obstacle to analysis, 
    the proposers must demonstrate clearly and satisfactorily how such potential 
    difficulties will be overcome.</b>" </p>

 </ul>

<p> <b> AS of 5/15/2013, volumes at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> which meet the 
  PGG basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing and 
  PDS certification are listed below. This list will be updated as 
  additional data become eligible. 
</p>
 <ul>

 </ul>

<p>In addition, Volumes <b>at the Ring-Moon Systems Node</b> which meet the PGG 
  basic eligibility requirements for publicly available timing but which 
  <b>have not</b> yet been certified by PDS are: 
</p>
 <ul>
  <li>VGISS_5101 through VGISS_5214 (Jupiter)</li>
  <li>VGISS_7201 through VGISS_7207 (Uranus)</li>

<h3>Finding PGG Relevant Data within the PDS</h3>

<b> Data at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</b>

 <ul> 
    <li><b> Search for data</b></li>
    
   <p><a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified 
   Search tool, allows users to search for and obtain subsets of 
   data based on a wide range of constraints. OPUS supports Cassini 
   CIRS, ISS, UVIS and VIMS data, New Horizons 
   Jupiter LORRI data, Galileo SSI data, and Voyager ISS data. 
   The results returned include preview products and tables of metadata.</p>
   
  <p><li><b>Browse</b> our <a href="/webapps/link/volumes/">Data Directories</a> </li></p>
  
  <p><li><b>Download</b> entire volumes<a href="/webapps/link/archives-volumes/"> as tar.gz files.</a></li></p>

  
    <li><b> Use our Mission Information Pages</b></li>
    
 <p>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with 
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data 
    and to Ring-Moon Systems Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams.</p>
  
  <ul> 
   <p><li><a href="/cassini">Cassini </a> Our Cassini mission pages support CIRS, 
    ISS, UVIS, and VIMS, including links to updated geometric metadata
        for these four instruments, plus occultation data obtained by RSS, UVS & VIMS, 
        and links to calibrated ISS images. </li>
   </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the 
     Small Bodies Node.</li>
    </p>
                 
  <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State 
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li>
    </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages 
   support ISS including new data sets of uncompressed, calibrated 
   and geometrically corrected images, IRIS, and occultation data 
   from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the 
   Voyager SPICE kernels generated at the Ring-Moon Systems Node.</li>
  </p>
    
  <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While 
   publicly available URPX observations obtained under Planetary 
   Astronomy Program are covered by this NRA, we do not currently 
   have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes available at 
   the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will 
   reflect it. </li>
  </p>
 
  </ul>
 </ul>

<b> Data available at other PDS nodes.</b>
 <ul>  
  <li><b> The PDS NAIF Node and observation geometry.</b></li>

  <p>SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
    <a href="//naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.SPICE 
   data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data 
   necessary to interpret scientific observations from space-based 
   instruments. The SPICE system also includes a large suite of 
   software, mostly in the form of subroutines, that users 
   incorporate in their own application programs to read SPICE 
   files and to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
   altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles.

<p><li>Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at 
    the PDS Engineering Node's 
<a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml"> ROSES support</a> page.</li>
</p>

 <li>For PDS wide search, start with the 
    <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>. 
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more 
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
