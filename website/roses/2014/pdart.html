<h2>Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools 2014</h2>

     
<p> <b>Latest update:</b> 6/23/14 - through Amendment 24.</p>

<h3>Critical Dates</h3>

<ul>
 <b><p>Step-1 proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7/17/14</p>
    <p>Step-2 proposal due date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9/17/14</p>
 </b> 
</p>
</ul>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><b> We provide a brief synopsis here; proposers must refer to the call 
    for specifics.</b>
</p>

<p> The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration, and Tools (PDART) 
    program is described in Appendix C.7. The full document can be 
    accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the <a 
    href="//nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>

<p> The Planetary Data Archiving, Restoration and Tools (PDART) 
    solicits proposals to generate higher-order data products, archive 
    and restore data sets or products, create or consolidate reference 
    databases, digitize data, and develop or validate software 
    tools. 
</p>

<p> For all types of proposals, it is expected that the products of 
    selected proposals will be made available to the scientific 
    community via the NASA PDS or equivalent archive. All proposals 
    will be evaluated on the perceived impact of the new data products 
    or tools on future planetary science research and exploration.
</p>



 
<h3>Archive Planning</h3>

 <ul>
    <ul><p><li>Requirements for depositing derived data products in the Planetary Data System have been revised to require that all products be PDS4 conformant. Guidelines for planning data in this format are available at 
        <a href = "//pds.nasa.gov/pds4"> Archiving under PDS4</a>.
    </li></p>
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Additional links within PDS</h3>

<ul>
 <p><li>Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at 
    the PDS Engineering Node's 
 <a href="//pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml"> ROSES support</a> page.</li>
 </p>
</ul>
