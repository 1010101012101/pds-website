## Welcome to the Ring-Moon Systems Node's ROSES 2017 NRA Support Pages

**Last updated: 3/3/2017, through Amendment 2.**

### Introduction

These pages are intended to assist proposers to the rings related programs in
the [ROSES 2017 NRA](https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?method=init&solId={E757EF32-60E6-76AE-A276-21A1F8BA96BB}&path=open).

Links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Nodes can be found at the PDS
Engineering Node's [ ROSES support](http://pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml)
page.

The "Data Status" tab provides the availability date and "PDS Certification"
status of each of the data sets or data volumes in the Ring-Moon Systems Node holdings.
The other tabs associated with this page provide information on data at the
Ring-Moon Systems Node relevant to the specific AO identified in the tab name.

The "Help for Proposers" tab provides some general information regarding proposals which include submitting data to PDS (e.g., information relevant to developing the required Data Management Plan).

The following table gives the key dates for each of the NRA's supported by
these pages based on ROSES 2017. We will attempt to keep these pages current
as relevant amendments to ROSES 2017 are released. However, the definitive
source is of course the [NSPIRES web
site.](http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/)

###  The Rings Related Research Programs

The links in the following table are to the respective Ring-Moon Systems Node support
pages (same destinations as the tabs at the top of the page).

### Additional PDS Support

The PDS has prepared a [Proposer's Archiving Guide](https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/documents/Individual-Proposers-Archive-Guide-v11.pdf), specifically to support DAP proposers. 

For more information about proposing with respect to PDS archiving, see the PDS Engineering Node's [Information for Proposers](https://pds.jpl.nasa.gov/pds4/propose/proposing.shtml) page.                                                     

The PDS Engineering Node's [ ROSES support](http://pds.nasa.gov/ROSES/roses.shtml) page includes links to ROSES support pages at the other PDS Discipline Nodes.
