<h2>Critical Dates</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>Notice of Intent due date:</b>  8/20/2010  
    <b>Proposal due date:</b> 10/15/2010 </p>
</ul>

 <p> The Planetary Mission Data Analysis Program (PMDAP) is 
   described in Appendix C.11 of the NRA. The full document 
   can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the <a 
   href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web 
   site.</a> </p> 
   
 <p> There are two distinct aspects to the PMDAP AO - Data Analysis 
    and Data Restoration. The criteria for the eligibilty of data are 
    significantly different for the two aspects.

<h2>Data Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<h3>Data Sources</h3>

<ul>
    
 <p>The broad data availability restrictions given for the 2010 
    PMDAP <b> for data analysis </b> are:  </p>
   
 <p>"The data <font size="2"><b> must be archived and publicly 
    available 30 days prior to the submission deadline for PMDAP 
    proposals.</b></font> Spacecraft data that have not been placed in 
    such [publicly accessible] archives may not be proposed for use in 
    PMDAP investigations."</p>
    
 <p>"Data accessible in PDS or other archives that are still in 'liens 
    resolution' are not considered archived and their analysis will 
    not be supported by this program."<p>    

 <p>"The PMDAP is not intended to overlap other active data analysis 
  programs. Thus the PMDAP does not support the analysis of:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>Lunar data</li>
     <li>Mars data obtained by missions to Mars</li> 
     <li>Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune system phenomena</li> 
     <li>Data from Cassini</li>
     <li>Data from the New Horizons, Galileo, Voyager, Pioneer, and Ulysses missions"</li>
  </ul>
</p>
</ul>  
 <p> While there are some exceptions to these restrictions (e.g., 
    Galileo asteroid flyby data), all of the data at the Rings Node falls 
    under one or more of the above exclusions. </p>

</ul>
<h2>Data restoration</h2>
<ul>
<p> PMDAP affords a unique opportunity for ring scientists to propose for the restoration of
    publicly available data sets. Individuals or teams interested in pursuing this opportunity should
    <a href="/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?"> contact us</a> early for assistance in identifying and obtaining eligible data, 
    or determining the PDS compliance requirements for the completed deliverables.
</P>
<p> Additional information regarding preparing data for the PDS is available through the
    <a href="archiving.html">Archiving</a> tab.
