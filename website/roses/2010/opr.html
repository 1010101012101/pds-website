<h2>Critical Dates</h2>
<ul>
<p><b>Notice of Intent due date:</b>  8/27/2010  
    <b>Proposal due date:</b> 10/22/2010. </p>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sources</h2>

<p> The Outer Planets Research (OPR) program is described in Appendix C.7 of the NRA.
    The full document can be accessed under <b>Solicitations</b> at the 
    <a href="http://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/">NSPIRES web site.</a> 
</p>
<p>The specific data availability restriction given for the 2010 OPR is:
</p>
<ul>

<p> "It is the responsibility of the investigators selected for this program to acquire any needed
data. Therefore, before submitting a proposal, the investigator must determine that all
data required for the proposed investigation are publicly available. Proposals requiring
the use of data that are not publicly available at the time of proposal submission may be
rejected without review. "</p>


 <p> <b> AS of 10/22/2010</b>, volumes at the Rings Node</b> which meet this basic availability requirement for OPR are</p>
 <ul>
    <li>ASTROM_nnnn</li>
    <li>COCIRS_0010 through 0912</li>
    <li>COCIRS_5401 through 5909</li>

<h2>Finding OPR Relevant Data within the PDS</h2>

<h3> The PDS NAIF Node</b> and observation geometery.</h3>
    
<p>SPICE data files contain spacecraft and solar system geometry data necessary to interpret 
scientific observations from space-based instruments. The SPICE 
     system also includes a large suite of software, mostly in 
     the form of subroutines, that users incorporate in 
     their own application programs to read SPICE files and 
     to compute derived observation geometry, such as 
     altitude, latitude/longitude, and lighting angles. 
     SPICE data and software may be obtained from the  
     <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/">NAIF web site</a>.
</p>
<p>Additionally, the Rings Node is generating complete SPICE C kernels for
    the Voyager encounters. As these kernels become available, links to them will be 
  added to our Voyager pages (see below).</p>
    
<h3> Data at the Rings Node.</h3>

<ul>  
    <p><li><a href="/search/">OPUS</a>, our Outer Planets Unified Search tool, allows
   users to search for and obtain subsets of data based on a wide range of constraints. At this time 
   the the tool supports Cassini CIRS, ISS and VIMS data, New Horizons Jupiter LORRI data, 
   Galileo SSI data, and Voyager ISS data. We plan to 
   continue extending the scope of the tool to address all of the data held at the Rings Node.</li></p>

  <p><li>Users may <a href="/vol/">browse our data volumes.</a></li></p>
  
  <p><li>Our mission information pages provide overviews of data sets and instruments along with 
    links to detailed descriptions of the instruments and to the data 
    and to Rings Node generated browse images and footprint diagrams. These pages are included 
    in the following set of links.</li></p>
  
 <ul> 
<p><li><a href="/cassini">Cassini </a> Our Cassini mission pages support CIRS, ISS, UVIS, and VIMS. 
    In addition see the <a href="cdap.html"> Cassini DAP </a>web page (although the eligibility cut 
    off date for data is later for OPR than for CDAP).</li></p>
    

 <p><li><a href="/newhorizons/">New Horizons </a>. Our New Horizon page
     provides access to the full set of LORRI Jupiter data and SPICE files, browse images
     for the LORRI data, and links to the full New Horizons Jupiter data collection at the 
                 Small Bodies Node.</li></p>
                 
 <p><li><a href="/galileo/">Galileo. </a>Our Galileo page supports the Solid State 
    Imager (SSI) and the Near-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS).  </li></p>
    
 <p><li><a href="/voyager/">Voyager. </a> Our Voyager pages support ISS, IRIS, and 
    occultation data from PPS, UVS, and RSS. These pages also provide access to the Voyager 
    SPICE kernels generated at the Rings Node.</li></p>
    
 <p><li><a href="/urpx/">Uranus Ring Plane Crossing </a>. While publicly available URPX 
                observations obtained under Planetary Astronomy Program are covered by this 
                NRA, we do not currently have any such data. If eligible URPX data becomes 
                available at the Ring's Node prior to the proposal deadline, this page will reflect it. </li></p>
 </ul>
</ul>
<h3> Data available at other PDS nodes.</h3>
 <ul>  
 <li>Start with the 
    <a href="http://pds.nasa.gov/tools/data-search/">PDS wide search engine</a>. 
    This search capability is limited, but initial results include links to relevant and much more 
    powerful discipline node search engines. </li>
</ul>
