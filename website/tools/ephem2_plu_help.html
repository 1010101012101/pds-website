# Pluto Ephemeris Generator Help

This form enables you to generate a table listing useful information about the
viewing geometry for Pluto and/or any of its moons as a function of time. You
are free to specify which of a variety of useful quantities to tabulate. The
file returned will contain a single header line describing each column,
followed by one row of numbers for each time step.

## Change History

**2.5** (February 28, 2014): Original Pluto ephemeris generator released. 

## Time Limits

The start and stop times (UTC) of the table can be entered in a variety of
formats. For example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`
If you want the gory details of how times are interpreted, click
[here](time_formats.html).

Enter the time interval to be used for the tabulation as a number in the box,
and select the time unit from the choices provided.

## General Column Selection

Click on the box to the left of each quantity or set of quantities that you
wish to tabulate. The order of the columns in the table will match the order
listed on the form. Possible selections are as follows:

  * Modified Julian Date Adds a column containing the Modified Julian Date, a common method of designating dates and times in astronomy. MJD is equal to the number of (possibly fractional) days elapsed since 0:00 UTC on 17 November 1858\. 
  * Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute Adds five columns containing the UTC date (year, month, day) and time (hours, minutes) as integers.
  * Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second Adds six columns containing the UTC date (year, month, day) and time (hours, minutes, seconds) as integers.
  * Pluto RA and Dec Adds two columns containing the J2000 right ascension and declination of Pluto. RA is tabulated in units of hours; declinations is in units of degrees.
  * Pluto phase angle Adds a column containing the phase angle of Pluto as seen from Earth, in degrees. This is equal to the Sun-Pluto-Earth angle.
  * Ring opening angle to Sun Adds a column containing the ring plane opening angle to the Sun, in degrees. This is equivalent to the sub-solar latitude as seen from Pluto; it equals zero during a ring plane crossing.
  * Ring opening angle to Earth Adds a column containing the ring plane opening angle to the Earth, in degrees. This is equivalent to the sub-Earth latitude as seen from Pluto; it equals zero during a ring plane crossing.
  * Sub-solar inertial longitude Adds a column containing the sub-solar longitude at Pluto, in degrees. This is measured from the J2000 ascending node of the planet's equatorial plane. Note that it is an inertial longitude, not measured in a frame rotating with the planet.
  * Sub-Earth inertial longitude Adds a column containing the sub-Earth longitude at Pluto, in degrees. This is measured from the J2000 ascending node of the planet's equatorial plane. Note that it is an inertial longitude, not measured in a frame rotating with the planet.
  * Sub-solar latitude and rotating longitude Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-solar latitude and longitude at Pluto, in degrees. This is measured in a frame rotating with the planet.
  * Sub-Earth latitude and rotating longitude Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-Earth latitude and longitude at Pluto, in degrees. This is measured in a frame rotating with the planet.
  * Pluto projected equatorial radius Adds a column containing the projected equatorial radius of Pluto as seen from Earth, in units of arcseconds.
  * Sun-Pluto distance Adds a column containing the Sun-Pluto distance, in km.
  * Earth-Pluto distance Adds a column containing the Earth-Pluto distance, in km.
  * Lunar phase angle Adds a column containing the phase angle of the Moon at the specified time, in degrees. A value near zero corresponds to a full moon; a value near 180 corresponds to a new moon.
  * Sun-Pluto sky separation angle Adds a column containing the angular separation on the sky from Pluto to the Sun, in degrees. A Sun-Pluto value near zero corresponds to solar conjunction; a value near 180 corresponds to opposition.
  * Moon-Pluto sky separation angle Adds a column containing the angular separation on the sky from Pluto to the Moon, in degrees.

## Moon Columns

You may also include the positions of any set of Pluto's moons in the table.
Up to four pairs of quantities can be tabulated for each selected moon:

  * RA and dec Adds a pair of columns containing the J2000 right ascension and declination for each selected moon. RA values are given in units of hours; dec values are given in degrees.
  * Offset RA and dec Adds a pair of columns containing the positional offset of each moon from the center of the planet. Values are given in units of arcseconds, where the first value is the offset in the direction of increasing J2000 RA and the second is in the direction of increasing dec.
  * Sub-solar latitude and rotating longitude Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-solar latitude and longitude on the selected moon, in degrees. These are measured in a frame rotating with the body.
  * Sub-Earth latitude and rotating longitude Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-Earth latitude and longitude on the selected moon, in degrees. These are measured in a frame rotating with the body.

Finally, click on the box to the left of each moon that you wish to include in
the table. Note that it is not necessary to include any moon columns at all.
