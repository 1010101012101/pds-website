# Pluto Ephemeris Generator Help

This form enables you to generate a table listing useful information
about the viewing geometry for Pluto and/or any of its moons as a
function of time.  You are free to specify which of a variety of useful
quantities to tabulate.  The file returned will contain a single header
line describing each column, followed by one row of numbers for each
time step. 

<h2>Change History</h2>

<b>2.5</b> (February 28, 2014): Original Pluto ephemeris generator released.

<h2><a name="TIME">Time Limits</a></h2>
The start and stop times (UTC) of the table can be entered in a variety
of formats.  For example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July
4, 1976: 
<ul>
<li><tt>1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00</tt></li>
<li><tt>July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am</tt></li>
<li><tt>12:01:02 am July 4, 1976</tt></li>
<li><tt>1976-07-04T00:01:02Z</tt> (<i>PDS format</i>)</li>
<li><tt>MJD 42963.00071759259</tt></li>
<li><tt>JD 2442963.50071759259</tt></li>
</ul>

Enter the time interval to be used for the tabulation as a number in the box,
and select the time unit from the choices provided.

<h2><a name="COLUMNS">General Column Selection</a></h2>
Click on the box to the left of each quantity or set of quantities that
you wish to tabulate.  The order of the columns in the table will match
the order listed on the form.  Possible selections are as follows: 
<ul>
<li>
Modified Julian Date
<ul>Adds a column containing the Modified Julian Date, a common method
of designating dates and times in astronomy.  MJD is equal to the number
of (possibly fractional) days elapsed since 0:00 UTC on 17 November
1858. </ul> 
</li><li>
Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute
<ul>Adds five columns containing the UTC date (year, month, day) and time 
(hours, minutes) as integers.</ul> 
</li><li>
Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second
<ul>Adds six columns containing the UTC date (year, month, day) and time 
(hours, minutes, seconds) as integers.</ul> 
</li><li>
Pluto RA and Dec
<ul>Adds two columns containing the J2000 right ascension and 
declination of Pluto.  RA is tabulated in units of hours; declinations 
is in units of degrees.</ul>
</li><li>
Pluto phase angle
<ul>Adds a column containing the phase angle of Pluto as seen from 
Earth, in degrees.  This is equal to the Sun-Pluto-Earth angle.</ul>
</li><li>
Ring opening angle to Sun
<ul>Adds a column containing the ring plane opening angle to the Sun, in
degrees.  This is equivalent to the sub-solar latitude as seen from
Pluto; it equals zero during a ring plane crossing.</ul> 
</li><li> 
Ring opening angle to Earth
<ul>Adds a column containing the ring plane opening angle to the Earth, in
degrees.  This is equivalent to the sub-Earth latitude as seen from
Pluto; it equals zero during a ring plane crossing.</ul> 
</li><li> 
Sub-solar inertial longitude
<ul>Adds a column containing the sub-solar longitude at Pluto, in
degrees.  This is measured from the J2000 ascending node of the planet's
equatorial plane.  Note that it is an inertial longitude, not measured
in a frame rotating with the planet.</ul> 
</li><li> 
Sub-Earth inertial longitude
<ul>Adds a column containing the sub-Earth longitude at Pluto, in
degrees.  This is measured from the J2000 ascending node of the planet's
equatorial plane.  Note that it is an inertial longitude, not measured
in a frame rotating with the planet.</ul> 
</li><li>
Sub-solar latitude and rotating longitude
<ul>Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-solar latitude and
longitude at Pluto, in degrees.  This is measured in a frame rotating
with the planet.</ul> 
</li><li>
Sub-Earth latitude and rotating longitude
<ul>Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-Earth latitude and
longitude at Pluto, in degrees.  This is measured in a frame rotating
with the planet.</ul> 
</li><li>
Pluto projected equatorial radius
<ul>Adds a column containing the projected equatorial radius of Pluto 
as seen from Earth, in units of arcseconds.</ul>
</li><li>
Sun-Pluto distance
<ul>Adds a column containing the Sun-Pluto distance, in km.</ul>
</li><li>
Earth-Pluto distance
<ul>Adds a column containing the Earth-Pluto distance, in km.</ul> 
</li><li>
Lunar phase angle
<ul>Adds a column containing the phase angle of the Moon at the 
specified time, in degrees.  A value near zero corresponds to a full 
moon; a value near 180 corresponds to a new moon.</ul>
</li><li>
Sun-Pluto sky separation angle
<ul>Adds a column containing the angular separation on the sky from
Pluto to the Sun, in degrees.  A Sun-Pluto value near zero
corresponds to solar conjunction; a value near 180 corresponds to
opposition.</ul> 
</li><li>
Moon-Pluto sky separation angle
<ul>Adds a column containing the angular separation on the sky
from Pluto to the Moon, in degrees.</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="MOONS">Moon Columns</a></h2>
You may also include the positions of any set of Pluto's moons in the
table.  Up to four pairs of quantities can be tabulated for each 
selected moon: 
<ul>
<li>
RA and dec
<ul>Adds a pair of columns containing the J2000 right ascension and 
declination for each selected moon.  RA values are given in units of 
hours; dec values are given in degrees.</ul>
</li><li>
Offset RA and dec
<ul>Adds a pair of columns containing the positional offset of each moon
from the center of the planet.  Values are given in units of arcseconds,
where the first value is the offset in the direction of increasing J2000 
RA and the second is in the direction of increasing dec.</ul>
</li><li>
Sub-solar latitude and rotating longitude
<ul>Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-solar latitude and
longitude on the selected moon, in degrees.  These are measured in a frame
rotating with the body.</ul> 
</li><li>
Sub-Earth latitude and rotating longitude
<ul>Adds a pair of columns containing the sub-Earth latitude and
longitude on the selected moon, in degrees.  These are measured in a frame
rotating with the body.</ul> 
</ul>
<p>
Finally, click on the box to the left of each moon that you wish to
include in the table.  Note that it is not necessary to include any 
moon columns at all.
