# Mars Viewer Help

This form enables you to generate a Postscript file showing the appearance of
the Martian system at a specified time. All bodies are rendered with
terminators and shadows as appropriate. Selected background stars can also be
included.

In the diagram, Mars and the moons are modeled as triaxial ellipsoids, and are
drawn with latitude and longitude contours at 15 degree intervals. Illuminated
regions are indicated with black lines; unilluminated regions and terminators
are shown as light gray. Penumbral shadows are not indicated.

Optionally, the hypothetical rings of Mars are also shown. Their appearances
are based on the model of

Krivov, A. V., and D. P. Hamilton 1997. Martian dust belts: Waiting for
discovery. _Icarus_ **128**, 335-353.  In this model, each of Mars' moons
generates a cloud of dust. The Phobos ring is modeled as equatorial but 350 km
thick and shifted toward the Sun by one Martian radius. The Deimos ring is
5300 km thick and shifted away from the Sun by two Martian radii. It is also
tilted out of the equatorial plane toward the ecliptic by 15 degrees. See the
above reference for the explanations of these surprising properties.

Each ring is shown by a pair of curves, one indicating each of its vertical
limits. The rings are shown in black if illuminated and in gray if not or if
the opposite side is illuminated. The Phobos ring is shown by solid lines; the
Deimos ring by dashed lines.

The diagram is oriented with J2000 declination increasing upward and with
right ascension increasing to the left. The frame has uniformly-spaced tick
marks along each axis. The declination axis is labeled in degrees, minutes and
seconds; the right ascension axis is labeled in hours, minutes and seconds.

Each diagram includes a caption that summarizes the key parameters used to
generate it.

## Change History

**2.0** (November 9, 1999): Original Mars viewer on line. (The version number was chosen for consistency with other tools.)   
**2.1** (December 1, 2009): Updated the default ephemerides. To reduce confusion, we have removed the choice about what ephemeris to use.   
**2.8** (January 23, 2013): Renumbered for consistency among all Planet Viewer tools. Ephemeris updates. 

## Observation Time

The observation time (UTC) can be entered in a variety of formats. For
example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`

[here](time_formats.html).

## Field of View

Enter the field of view of the drawing to be generated and select the
appropriate units. Units can be seconds of arc (the default), Martian radii,
or kilometers (projected at the distance to Mars).

## Diagram Center

Three different methods of specifying the diagram center are supported. Click
on the box to the left of the option you wish to use.

**Body:** The diagram will be centered on the location of the selected body. 

**Ring ansa**: The diagram will be centered on the ansa of the selected ring. Specify the east or west ansa using the second box. Note that east is toward the left in the diagram. 

**J2000 RA and dec:** The diagram will be centered on the specified pair of right ascension and declination coordinates. The first box is for the RA and the second box is for the dec. Enter up to three values in each box, separated by spaces. The values are interpreted as hours, minutes and seconds, respectively in the RA box and as degrees, minutes and seconds in the dec box. Any or all values can have fractional parts. 

## Viewpoint

You may specify the point of view of the diagram. By default, the point of
view is the center of the Earth.

**Observatory:** You may select from any viewpoint on the list. 

  * **Earth's center**
  * **Named observatories:** After each observatory's name, you will see listed its latitude and east longitude in degrees, followed by its altitude in meters. Note that only very rarely will a diagram change significantly based on the particular location of an Earth-based observatory. 

**Latitude & Longitude:** If your desired observatory or location is not on the observatory list, you can enter its latitude, longitude and altitude in the three boxes provided. Latitudes and longitudes can each be specified by up to three values, interpreted as degrees, minutes and seconds. Longitudes can be specified either east or west. 

If you wish to have an observatory added to the standard list, or to refine
the coordinates of a listed observatory, email the necessary information to
[Mark Showalter](/showalter/).

## Ring Selection

You can decide whether to include the hypothetical Martian rings in the
diagram. Click on the box to the left to select your option. If selected, both
rings are indicated by pairs of dashed lines above and below the ring plane to
indicate these rings' physical thickness. The Phobos ring is shown with a
solid line and the Deimos ring is shown with a dashed line.

See above for a discussion of the models used for each ring.

## Background Objects

You have several independent options for including background objects in the
diagrams. These options make it possible to render diagrams around the times
of stellar occultations. Objects are marked by pluses and are labeled by name
if the Moon & Star Labels option is activated.

**Standard stars:** Check the box to include any of a standard list of stars that happen to fall inside the field of view of the diagram. The Mars Viewer does not access a star catalog; instead, it only plots stars from a finite list. To view the current star list, click [here](starlist_mar.txt). This list is updated periodically at the request of the users; if you would like to have a star added to the list, email the necessary information to [Mark Showalter](/showalter/). 

**Additional star:** In addition to or instead of the standard stars, you can specify one additional star to be included in the diagram. Check the box to the left and enter the star's RA, dec, and name in the three boxes. Enter up to three values in the RA and dec boxes, separated by spaces. The values are interpreted as hours, minutes and seconds, respectively in the RA box and as degrees, minutes and seconds in the dec box. Any or all values can have fractional parts. 

## Title

Enter a title for the plot in this box. It will appear centered above the
diagram.

## Moon and Star Labels

Optionally, the diagram will be generated with the name of each moon and star
written above and to the right of its center. You may select the size of these
labels in points, where a point is 1/72 inches.

## Moon Enlargement

The diagram is rendered to scale, which means that Mars' moons may be very
hard to see. You may enter a minimum plotted size for moons in this box. If a
nonzero value is used, the smallest moons will be easier to see. The size is
in units of points, equal to 1/72 inches. A value of ~4 may be appropriate.

## Blank Disks

If you activate this option, all latitude and longitude lines will be
suppressed in the diagram. This produces a diagram that is suitable for
amateur observers to use as a drawing blank.
