# Cassini/Saturn Moon Tracker Help

This form enables you to generate a Postscript file showing the east-west
motion of Saturnian satellites within a specified time period, as viewed from
Cassini. The distance of each selected moon from the planet's axis is plotted
in units of either degrees or Saturnian radii. Positive values correspond to
bodies on the "morning" (east) side of Saturn and negative values by the
"evening" (west) side. In the diagram, the limbs of Saturn are indicated by a
dark gray stripe down the middle. The locations of the rings can be added as
bands in lighter gray. Time increases downward on the plot.

The Tracker tool also allows you to download an ASCII table containing the
numeric values that went into the diagram. The file contains a single header
line followed by the numbers. Columns are as follows:

Modified Julian Date (UTC)  
Year  
Month  
Day  
Hour  
Minute  
Projected equatorial radius of planet (degrees)  
Distance of first moon from planet's axis (degrees)  
Distance of second moon from planet's axis (degrees)  
etc.

## Change History

**1.0** (July 21, 2001): Original Cassini/Saturn Moon Tracker, based on the Earth-based [Saturn Moon Tracker](tracker2_sat.html).  
**1.1** (January 2, 2002): Updated for the official Cassini tour as of 1 December 2002.  
**1.2** (January 9, 2003): Phoebe added as a satellite choice. An option added for second accuracy in time tags.  
**1.3** (August 30, 2007): Added Cassini-discovered moons and the latest ephemeris options. Also added the tour for the Cassini extended mission.   
**1.4** (December 1, 2009): Updated the default ephemerides. To reduce confusion, we have removed the choice about what ephemeris to use.   
**1.5** (January 23, 2013): Anthe and Aegaeon added. Renumbered for consistency across all the Ephemeris Generator tools. Ephemeris updates. 

## Time Limits

The start and stop times (UTC) of the plot can be entered in a variety of
formats. For example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`
If you want the gory details of how times are interpreted, click
[here](time_formats.html).

**Interval**: Enter the time interval to be used for the tabulation as a number in the box, and select the time unit from the choices provided. Start times and intervals are rounded to the nearest minute. 

## Plot Options

**Scale**: Enter the numeric range and units of the horizontal axis. The value you enter is actually half the width of the diagram; for example, if you enter 10 Saturn radii, then the axis will run from -10 to 10. Zero always falls at the middle of the plot. 

**Title**: Enter a title for the plot in this box. It will appear centered above the diagram. 

## Moon Selection

Click on the box to the left of each moon that you wish to include in the
diagram and in the tabulation.

## Ring Selection

Click on the box to the left of each ring that you wish to include in the
diagram. Rings appear as gray vertical stripes on the plot. For plotting
purposes, the main rings are shown extending from the A Ring's outer edge
(136780 km) all the way down to the planet. The E Ring is plotted between 3
and 5 Saturnian radii, although it actually extends outward much further.
