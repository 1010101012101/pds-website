# Help Page for the Cassini Viewfinder 1.1

This tool enables you to select times during the Cassini Tour when Cassini's
viewpoint satisfies specified geometric constraints. Simply enter the desired
lower or upper limit (or both) on any field in the form, click "Submit," and a
table of the time intervals that satisfy the constraints is returned. You can
then, for example, cut and paste the times into the [Cassini/Saturn
Viewer](viewer2_satc.html) tool to generate a diagram of the viewing geometry
for that moment. Leave the form blank for any parameters that you do not wish
to constrain.

**NOTE**: This tool is operational but not currently supported. Its primary purpose was for Cassini mission planning. An update may be released to support the Cassini extended mission. 

## Details

This tool uses a table of viewing geometry parameters sampled every ten
minutes during the Cassini tour. The tool simply searches the database for all
rows in the table that match the constraints and groups consecutive rows
together in the output. Because of the sampling, viewing opportunities that
exist for shorter than ten minutes might be missed. In addition, the estimated
duration of a particular viewing geometry could be in error by +/- ten
minutes.

The viewing geometry is actually tabulated for the planet, not the rings. Keep
in mind that, particularly when close in, the rings can span a signficant
range of phase angles, distances, solar hour angles, etc.

The time limits of the table are from May 1, 2004 (about three months before
Saturn orbit insertion) to July 1, 2007.

## Change History

**1.0 Beta** (December 27, 2000) Original beta test of Cassini viewfinder form on line.  
**1.0** (January 4, 2001) Database replaced with one that samples the tour at ten-minute intervals rather than two-hour intervals.  
**1.1** (July 20, 2001) New options provided for the revised Saturn tour, yyyy-ddd date formats, and planetocentric vs. planetographic latitude.

## Tour

You may select between the original T18-5 tour and the revised tour S2-C22 in
which the first two orbits have been changed to allow for the revised Titan
probe delivery. The latter is the default but the former is provided for
backward-compatibility.

Note that orbit numbers are 0, A, B, C, 3, 4, ... in the revised tour. This is
because two orbits in the original tour were changed into three in the revised
tour. With this nomenclature, subsequent orbit numbers are unchanged.

## Date Format

You may select between "yyyy-mm-dd" and "yyyy-ddd" date formats. You always
have freedom to use either format in input fields; this merely affects the
format of the output.

## Latitude Type

You may select between planetographic and planetocentric latitude;
planetocentric is the default. The planetocentric latitude is equivalent to
the ring opening angle. The difference can be ~5 degrees at mid-latitudes.

## Observation Time

The observation time gives the time UTC at which the given viewing geometry
occurs. Times are given by default in PDS format, of the form "yyyy-mm-
ddThh:mm:ss.sss". However, in the queries, times can be entered in a broad
range of formats; click [here](time_formats.html) for the gory details.

## Orbit Number

The orbits are numbered from one apoapse to the next. The first orbit,
containing SOI, is number 0.

## Range

Range is the distance to the center of Saturn in units of Saturn radii, 60330
km.

## Sub-Spacecraft Latitude

The sub-spacecraft latitude is the latitude on the planet directly beneath the
spacecraft, in degrees. It can range from -90 to 90. It is roughly equivalent
to the ring opening angle. Note that it is negative for views of the south
side of the rings and positive for views of the north side.

## Sub-Solar Latitude

The sub-solar latitude is the latitude on the planet directly beneath the Sun,
in degrees. It can range from -90 to 90. However, it is always negative during
the Cassini Tour because the Sun shines on the south side of the rings.

## Solar Hour Angle

The solar angle hour measures the spacecraft-planet-antisolar direction as
projected into the ring plane, in degrees. It can range from 0 to 360\. It is
measured in the direction of ring rotation so SHA=90 places Cassini above the
morning quadrant of the rings (where the ring material has just emerged from
shadow) and SHA=270 places Cassini above the evening quadrant (where ring
material is heading into the shadow).

## Phase Angle

The phase angle is the spacecraft-planet-Sun angle, in degrees. It can range
from 0 to 180.

## Duration

The duration is the approximate time interval over which a specified viewing
geometry exists, in hours. Note that this value can be in error by up to +/-
10 minutes.
