# Uranus Moon Tracker Help

This form enables you to generate a Postscript file showing the east-west
motion of Uranian satellites within a specified time period. The distance of
each selected moon from the planet's axis is plotted in units of either arcsec
or Uranus radii. Positive values correspond to bodies on the "morning" (east)
side of Uranus and negative values by the "evening" (west) side. In the
diagram, the limbs of Uranus are indicated by a dark gray stripe down the
middle. The location of the Epsilon Ring can be added as a band in lighter
gray. Time increases downward on the plot.

The Tracker tool also allows you to download an ASCII table containing the
numeric values that went into the diagram. The file contains a single header
line followed by the numbers. Columns are as follows:

Modified Julian Date (UTC)  
Year  
Month  
Day  
Hour  
Minute  
Projected equatorial radius of planet (arcsec)  
Distance of first moon from planet's axis (arcsec)  
Distance of second moon from planet's axis (arcsec)  
etc.

## Change History

**1.0** (February 3, 1997): Original Uranus moon tracker on line.   
**1.1** (February 8, 1997): Older ephemerides URA027 and URA032 added, making it possible to generate diagrams for a longer range of times.   
**2.0** (January 12, 1999): Revised user interface. Added two new ephemeris options.   
**2.1** (August 24, 2006): Added Perdita, Mab and Cupid.   
**2.3** (November 9, 2009): Updated the default ephemerides. To reduce confusion, we have removed the choice about what ephemeris to use. Version number modified for consistency with the other Uranus tools.   
**2.5** (January 23, 2013): Renumbered for consistency across all the Moon Tracker tools. Ephemeris updates. 

## Time Limits

The start and stop times (UTC) of the plot can be entered in a variety of
formats. For example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`
If you want the gory details of how times are interpreted, click
[here](time_formats.html).

**Interval**: Enter the time interval to be used for the tabulation as a number in the box, and select the time unit from the choices provided. Start times and intervals are rounded to the nearest minute. 

## Plot Options

**Scale**: Enter the numeric range and units of the horizontal axis. The value you enter is actually half the width of the diagram; for example, if you enter 10 Uranus radii, then the axis will run from -10 to 10. Zero always falls at the middle of the plot. 

**Title**: Enter a title for the plot in this box. It will appear centered above the diagram. 

## Moon Selection

Click on the box to the left of each moon that you wish to include in the
diagram and in the tabulation.

## Ring Selection

Click on the box to include the outer boundary of the ring system (i.e. the
Epsilon ring semimajor axis) in the plot. It will appear as a vertical gray
stripe on each side of the planet.
