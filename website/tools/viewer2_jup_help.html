# Jupiter Viewer Help

This form enables you to generate a Postscript file showing the appearance of
the Jupiter system at a specified time. All bodies are rendered with
terminators and shadows as appropriate. Selected background stars can also be
included.

In the diagram, Jupiter and the moons are modeled as triaxial ellipsoids, and
are drawn with latitude and longitude contours at 15 degree intervals.
Illuminated regions are indicated with black lines; unilluminated regions and
terminators are shown as light gray. Penumbral shadows are not indicated.

Optionally, the main and gossamer rings are also drawn. The rings are are
shown in black if illuminated and in gray if not or if the opposite side is
illuminated. The main ring is shown by its inner and outer boundaries; the
gossamer ring is shown by separate Amalthea and Thebe rings, each indicated by
a pair of dashed lines at the ring's upper and lower vertical limits.

The diagram is oriented with J2000 declination increasing upward and with
right ascension increasing to the left. The frame has uniformly-spaced tick
marks along each axis. The declination axis is labeled in degrees, minutes and
seconds; the right ascension axis is labeled in hours, minutes and seconds.

Each diagram includes a caption that summarizes the key parameters used to
generate it.

**Limitations**. The outer irregular satellites of Jupiter are not shown. 

## Change History

**1.0** (January 28, 1997): Original Jupiter viewer on line.   
**1.1** (February 6, 1997): Additional information at the bottom of the "results" page includes the sub-solar and sub-Earth longitude.   
**1.2** (February 11, 1997): Added a new ephemeris option ("Pre-RPX #2").   
**2.0** (February 1, 1999): Added a new ephemeris option ("Post-Galileo"). Added a viewpoint option including both Voyagers, the Galileo Orbiter and parallax corrections for Earth-based observatories. Added alternative units (Jupiter radii, kilometers, and instrument fields of view) to the field of view options. Revised the diagrams to show the Gossamer Ring as separate Amalthea and Thebe rings, with the vertical extent of each ring indicated. Added background star options. Added an option to suppress latitude and longitude lines, producing diagrams that are suitable as drawing blanks for amateur observers. Added distances and light travel time to output table.   
**2.1** (December 20, 1999): Added an Io torus option.   
**2.2** (December 6, 2000): Added a Cassini viewpoint and various Cassini instrument fields of view. Also extended the Galileo orbiter ephemeris to September 2003.   
**2.3** (January 31, 2002): Added new ephemeris option ("Post-Galileo #2"). Extended ephemeris time limits for small satellites. Added star name option for diagram center. Added hour/degree options for right ascensions.  
  
**2.4** (December 1, 2009): Updated the default ephemerides. To reduce confusion, we have removed the choice about what ephemeris to use.   
**2.8** (January 23, 2013): Renumbered for consistency among all Planet Viewer tools. Ephemeris updates. 

## Observation Time

The observation time (UTC) can be entered in a variety of formats. For
example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`
If you want the gory details of how times are interpreted, click
[here](time_formats.html).

## Field of View

Enter the field of view of the drawing to be generated and select the
appropriate units. Units can be seconds of arc (the default), Jupiter radii,
kilometers (projected at the distance to Jupiter), or the fields of view of
the Voyager, Galileo and Cassini cameras.

## Diagram Center

Four different methods of specifying the diagram center are supported. Click
on the box to the left of the option you wish to use.

**Body:** The diagram will be centered on the location of the selected body. 

**Ring ansa**: The diagram will be centered on the ansa of the selected ring. Specify the east or west ansa using the second box. Note that east is toward the left in the diagram. 

**J2000 RA and dec:** The diagram will be centered on the specified pair of right ascension and declination coordinates. The first box is for the RA and the second box is for the dec. You may also specify whether the RA is in units of hours or degrees. Enter up to three values in each box, separated by spaces; these values are interpreted as degrees/hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. Any or all values can have fractional parts. 

**Star name:** Enter the name of a star as it appears in the current [list](starlist_jup.txt). The name must match exactly. 

## Viewpoint

You may specify the point of view of the diagram. By default, the point of
view is the center of the Earth.

**Observatory:** You may select from any viewpoint on the list. 

  * **Earth's center**
  * **Voyager 1:** Valid for the period 1979-Feb-06 to 1979-Apr-09. 
  * **Voyager 2:** Valid for the period 1979-Jun-25 to 1979-Aug-29. 
  * **Galileo Orbiter:** Valid for the period 1995-Jul-01 to 2003-Sep-21. 
  * **Named observatories:** After each observatory's name, you will see listed its latitude and east longitude in degrees, followed by its altitude in meters. Note that only very rarely will a diagram change significantly based on the particular location of an Earth-based observatory. 

**Latitude & Longitude:** If your desired observatory or location is not on the observatory list, you can enter its latitude, longitude and altitude in the three boxes provided. Latitudes and longitudes can each be specified by up to three values, interpreted as degrees, minutes and seconds. Longitudes can be specified either east or west. 

If you wish to have an observatory added to the standard list, or to refine
the coordinates of a listed observatory, email the necessary information to
[Mark Showalter](/showalter/).

## Moon Selection

You can decide which moons to include in the diagram. At minimum, the Galilean
satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto are included. Use the boxes to
the left of the list to choose the smallest set of moons to include. Note
that, whatever your choice, the moons appearing above it in the list will also
be shown.

## Ring Selection

You can decide which ring to include in the diagram, if any. Click on the box
to the left to show the main ring or the gossamer rings. The gossamer rings
are indicated by pairs of dashed lines above and below the ring plane to
indicate these rings' physical thickness.

Optionally, you can include a rendering of the **Io torus** by checking the
associated box. If selected, the torus is shown as a dashed line. In the
adjacent text boxes you can enter the desired inclination and radius; default
values correspond to the centrifugal equator at Io's orbit. An inclination of
zero corresponds to the equatorial plane and an inclination of 9.6 degrees
corresponds to the magnetic equator.

## Background Objects

You have several independent options for including background objects in the
diagrams. These options make it possible to render diagrams around the times
of stellar or spacecraft occultations. Objects are marked by pluses and are
labeled by name if the Moon & Star Labels option is activated.

**Standard stars:** Check the box to include any of a standard list of stars that happen to fall inside the field of view of the diagram. The Jupiter Viewer does not access a star catalog; instead, it only plots stars from a finite list. To view the current star list, click [here](starlist_jup.txt). This list is updated periodically at the request of the users; if you would like to have a star added to the list, email the necessary information to [Mark Showalter](/showalter/). 

**Additional star:** In addition to or instead of the standard stars, you can specify one additional star to be included in the diagram. Check the box to the left and enter the star's RA, dec, and name in the three boxes. You may also specify whether the RA is in units of hours or degrees. Enter up to three values in the RA and dec boxes, separated by spaces; the values are interpreted as hours/degrees, minutes and seconds, respectively. Any or all values can have fractional parts. 

**Other bodies:** Check each box to mark the location of the specified body or spacecraft in the diagram. 

## Title

Enter a title for the plot in this box. It will appear centered above the
diagram.

## Moon and Star Labels

Optionally, the diagram will be generated with the name of each moon and star
written above and to the right of its center. You may select the size of these
labels in points, where a point is 1/72 inches.

## Moon Enlargement

The diagram is rendered to scale, which means that some of the smallest Jovian
moons may be very hard to see. You may enter a minimum plotted size for moons
in this box. If a nonzero value is used, the smallest moons will be easier to
see. The size is in units of points, equal to 1/72 inches. A value of ~4 may
be appropriate.

## Blank Disks

If you activate this option, all latitude and longitude lines will be
suppressed in the diagram. This produces a diagram that is suitable for
amateur observers to use as a drawing blank.
