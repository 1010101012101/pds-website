# Martian Moon Tracker Help

This form enables you to generate a Postscript file showing the east-west
motion of the Martian satellites within a specified time period. The distance
of each selected moon from the planet's axis is plotted in units of either
arcsec or Martian radii. Positive values correspond to bodies on the "morning"
(east) side of Mars and negative values by the "evening" (west) side. In the
diagram, the limbs of Mars are indicated by a dark gray stripe down the
middle. Time increases downward on the plot.

The Tracker tool also allows you to download an ASCII table containing the
numeric values that went into the diagram. The file contains a single header
line followed by the numbers. Columns are as follows:

Modified Julian Date (UTC)  
Year  
Month  
Day  
Hour  
Minute  
Projected equatorial radius of planet (arcsec)  
Distance of first moon from planet's axis (arcsec)  
Distance of second moon from planet's axis (arcsec)  
etc.

## Change History

**2.0** (November 9, 1999): Original Martian Moon Tracker on line. (The version number was chosen for consistency with other tools.)   
**2.1** (December 1, 2009): Updated the default ephemerides. To reduce confusion, we have removed the choice about what ephemeris to use.   
**2.5** (January 23, 2013): Renumbered for consistency across all the Moon Tracker tools. Ephemeris updates. 

## Time Limits

The start and stop times (UTC) of the plot can be entered in a variety of
formats. For example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`
If you want the gory details of how times are interpreted, click
[here](time_formats.html).

**Interval**: Enter the time interval to be used for the tabulation as a number in the box, and select the time unit from the choices provided. Start times and intervals are rounded to the nearest minute. 

## Plot Options

**Scale**: Enter the numeric range and units of the horizontal axis. The value you enter is actually half the width of the diagram; for example, if you enter 10 Martian radii, then the axis will run from -10 to 10. Zero always falls at the middle of the plot. 

**Title**: Enter a title for the plot in this box. It will appear centered above the diagram. 

## Moon Selection

Click on the box to the left of each moon that you wish to include in the
diagram and in the tabulation. By default, both Phobos and Deimos are
selected.
