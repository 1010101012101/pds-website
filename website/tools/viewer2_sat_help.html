# Saturn Viewer Help

This form enables you to generate a Postscript file showing the appearance of
the Saturn system at a specified time. All bodies are rendered with
terminators and shadows as appropriate. Selected background stars can also be
included.

In the diagram, Saturn and the moons are modeled as triaxial ellipsoids, and
are drawn with latitude and longitude contours at 15 degree intervals.
Illuminated regions are indicated with black lines; unilluminated regions and
terminators are shown as light gray. Penumbral shadows are not indicated.

The following ring boundaries are drawn: A Ring outer edge; A Ring inner edge;
B Ring outer edge, B/C Ring boundary; C Ring inner edge. The rings are shown
in black if illuminated and in gray if not. Optionally, the E, F and G Rings
can be drawn as dashed lines.

The diagram is oriented with J2000 declination increasing upward and with
right ascension increasing to the left. The frame has uniformly-spaced tick
marks along each axis. The declination axis is labeled in degrees, minutes and
seconds; the right ascension axis is labeled in hours, minutes and seconds.

Each diagram includes a caption that summarizes the key parameters used to
generate it.

**Limitations**. If you zoom in on Hyperion, its orientation will be incorrect because the SPICE data files do not contain a model for its chaotic rotation. Prometheus and Pandora's rotations are not corrected for their orbital wanderings. 

## Change History

**RPX Viewer 1.0** (January 17, 1995): Original Saturn viewer for 1995-6 ring plane crossing observations.   
**1.1** (December 11, 1995): Revised to use a better ephemeris based on a few 1995 observations.   
**Saturn Viewer 1.0** (January 28, 1997): New interface, allowing for a choice of ephemerides, greater control over the figure contents and more informative figure captions.   
**1.1** (February 6, 1997): Additional information at the bottom of the "results" page includes the subsolar and sub-Earth longitude.   
**2.0** (February 1, 1999): Expanded ephemeris time limits and added a new ephemeris option. Added a viewpoint option including Voyager 1, Voyager 2, and parallax corrections for Earth-based observatories. Added alternative units (Saturn radii, kilometers, and the Voyager camera fields of view) to the field of view options. Added background star options. Added an option to suppress latitude and longitude lines, producing diagrams that are suitable as drawing blanks for amateur observers. Added distances and light travel time to output table.

## Observation Time

The observation time (UTC) can be entered in a variety of formats. For
example, the following all parse to 0:01:02 UTC on July 4, 1976:

  * `1976-JUL-04 00:01:02.00`
  * `July 4, 1976 12:01:02 am`
  * `12:01:02 am July 4, 1976`
  * `1976-07-04T00:01:02Z` (_PDS format_)
  * `MJD 42963.00071759259`
  * `JD 2442963.50071759259`
If you want the gory details of how times are interpreted, click
[here](time_formats.html).

## Field of View

Enter the field of view of the drawing to be generated and select the
appropriate units. Units can be seconds of arc (the default), Saturn radii,
kilometers (projected at the distance to Saturn) or the fields of view of the
Voyager or Cassini cameras.

## Diagram Center

Four different methods of specifying the diagram center are supported. Click
on the box to the left of the option you wish to use.

**Body:** The diagram will be centered on the location of the selected body. 

**Ring ansa**: The diagram will be centered on the ansa of the selected ring. Specify the east or west ansa using the second box. Note that east is toward the left in the diagram. 

**J2000 RA and dec:** The diagram will be centered on the specified pair of right ascension and declination coordinates. The first box is for the RA and the second box is for the dec. You may also specify whether the RA is in units of hours or degrees. Enter up to three values in each box, separated by spaces; these values are interpreted as degrees/hours, minutes and seconds, respectively. Any or all values can have fractional parts. 

**Star name:** Enter the name of a star as it appears in the current [list](starlist_sat.txt). The name must match exactly. 

## Viewpoint

You may specify the point of view of the diagram. By default, the point of
view is the center of the Earth.

**Observatory:**

  * **Earth's center**
  * **Voyager 1:** Valid for the period 1980-Aug-23 to 1981-Jan-01. 
  * **Voyager 2:** Valid for the period 1981-Jun-01 to 1981-Oct-22. 
  * **Cassini:** Valid for the period 2000-Nov-09 to 2008-Aug-09. 
  * **Named observatories:** After each observatory's name, you will see listed its latitude and east longitude in degrees, followed by its altitude in meters. Note that only very rarely will a diagram change significantly based on the particular location of an Earth-based observatory. 

**Latitude & Longitude:** If your desired observatory or location is not on the observatory list, you can enter its latitude, longitude and altitude in the three boxes provided. Latitudes and longitudes can each be specified by up to three values, interpreted as degrees, minutes and seconds. Longitudes can be specified either east or west. 

If you wish to have an observatory added to the standard list, or to refine
the coordinates of a listed observatory, email the necessary information to
[Mark Showalter](/showalter/).

## Moon Selection

You can decide which moons to include in the diagram. At minimum, the moons
Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion, Iapetus and Phoebe are
included. Use the boxes to the left of the list to choose the smallest set of
moons to be included. Note that, whatever your choice, the moons appearing
above it in the list will also be included.

## Ring Selection

You can decide which ring to include in the diagram. At minimum, the A, B and
C Ring boundaries are shown. Click on the box to the left to show the F Ring,
the E Ring core and the G Ring. For each selection, the rings appearing above
it on the list will also be included. If selected, the E, F and G Rings are
plotted as dashed lines to distinguish them from their brighter counterparts.
The F Ring is plotted with accurate eccentricity and inclination, using the
model of Bosh et al. (Icarus **157**, 57-75, 2002).

## Background Objects

You have several independent options for including background objects in the
diagrams. These options make it possible to render diagrams around the times
of stellar or spacecraft occultations. Objects are marked by pluses and are
labeled by name if the Moon & Star Labels option is activated.

**Standard stars:** Check the box to include any of a standard list of stars that happen to fall inside the field of view of the diagram. The Jupiter Viewer does not access a star catalog; instead, it only plots stars from a finite list. To view the current star list, click [here](starlist_sat.txt). This list is updated periodically at the request of the users; if you would like to have a star added to the list, email the necessary information to [Mark Showalter](/showalter/). 

**Additional star:** In addition to or instead of the standard stars, you can specify one additional star to be included in the diagram. Check the box to the left and enter the star's RA, dec, and name in the three boxes. You may also specify whether the RA is in units of hours or degrees. Enter up to three values in the RA and dec boxes, separated by spaces; the values are interpreted as hours/degrees, minutes and seconds, respectively. Any or all values can have fractional parts. 

**Other bodies:** Check each box to mark the location of the specified body or spacecraft in the diagram. 

## Title

Enter a title for the plot in this box. It will appear centered above the
diagram.

## Moon and Star Labels

Optionally, the diagram will be generated with the name of each moon and star
written above and to the right of its center. You may select the size of these
labels in points, where a point is 1/72 inches.

## Moon Enlargement

The diagram is rendered to scale, which means that some of the smallest
Saturnian moons may be very hard to see. You may enter a minimum plotted size
for moons in this box. If a nonzero value is used, the smallest moons will be
easier to see. The size is in units of points, equal to 1/72 inches. A value
of ~4 may be appropriate.

## Blank Disks

If you activate this option, all latitude and longitude lines will be
suppressed in the diagram. This produces a diagram that is suitable for
amateur observers to use as a drawing blank.

## Ring Plot Type

You have three options for how Saturn's A, B, and C rings are plotted. In the
"Transparent" option, the ring boundaries are drawn but everything behind the
rings is shown normally. In this case, the rings do not cast shadows. In the
"Opaque" option, the rings are opaque from the A Ring's outer edge all the way
down to the planet. The rings do cast shadows and objects behind them are
invisible (including objects that would normally be visible interior to the C
Ring). In the "Semi-transparent" option, objects behind the rings are subdued
in gray but are still visible. The rings do cast shadows. This option
generates the most realistic view but, because of limitations of the toolkit
used to generate the diagram, generates a Postscript file up to twice as large
as with the other options.

## Pericenter Markers

You have the option of placing a dot at the location of the pericenter of the
eccentric F Ring in the diagram. Select whether you want to mark no rings or
the F Ring. Also enter the size of the dot, in units of points (= 1/72
inches).
