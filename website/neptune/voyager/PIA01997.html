**Caption:**

These two 591-second exposures of the rings of Neptune were taken with
the clear filter by the Voyager 2 wide-angle camera on Aug.  26, 1989
from a distance of 280,000 kilometers (175,000 miles).  The two main
rings are clearly visible and appear complete over the region
imaged. The time between exposures was one hour and 27
minutes. [During this period the bright ring arcs in the outer bright
ring were not visible in either picture (they were unfortunately on
the opposite side of the planet for each exposure).] Also visible in
this image is the inner faint ring at about 42,000 kilometers (25,000
miles) from the center of Neptune, and the faint band which extends
smoothly from the 53,000 kilometer (33,000 miles) ring to roughly
halfway between the two bright rings. Both of these newly discovered
rings are broad and much fainter than the two narrow rings. These long
exposure images were taken while the rings were back-lighted by the
sun at a [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) of 135 degrees. This viewing geometry enhances
the visibility of dust and allows fainter, dusty parts of the ring to
be seen. The bright glare in the center is due to over-exposure of the
crescent of Neptune. The two gaps in the upper part of the outer ring
in the image on the left are due to blemish removal in the computer
processing. Numerous bright stars are evident in the background. Both
bright rings have material throughout their entire orbit, and are
therefore continuous. The Voyager Mission is conducted by JPL for
NASA's Office of Space Science and Applications.
