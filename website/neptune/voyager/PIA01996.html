**Caption:**

The Voyager spacecraft took this picture after closest approach to
Neptune on Aug. 25 1989, using the clear filter of the wide- angle
camera with an exposure time of 255 seconds. The view back towards
Neptune at a [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) of 135 degrees found the two known rings to
be five to 10 times brighter than seen in backscattering during
Voyager approach at much lower [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle).  This brightness increase
implies a large percentage of microscopic particles within the
rings. Although the dominant arc-like clump of the outer ring is not
seen here, the inner ring appears brighter than the outer ring at the
longitudes seen in this image. A faint sheet of material is also
revealed that extends from the faint ring at a radius of 53,200
kilometers (33,000 miles). A new and even fainter ring was discovered
in this image at about 41,000 kilometers (25,400 miles), seen running
from the lower left corner to about one-third the way across the top
of the frame. This ring is quite broad, about 2,500 kilometers (1,550
miles) in radial width. In contrast to the two previously discovered
rings, this feature is quite diffuse and has no well defined radial
boundaries. The Voyager imaging experiment has now detected ring
material in all of the radial regions in which it has been detected by
groundbased stellar [occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiments. The Voyager spacecraft
was 720,000 kilometers (446,400 miles) from Neptune at the time of
this exposure.  The Voyager Mission is conducted by JPL for NASA's
Office of Space Science and Applications.
