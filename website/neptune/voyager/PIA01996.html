**Caption: **

The Voyager spacecraft took this picture after closest approach to Neptune on
Aug. 25 1989, using the clear filter of the wide- angle camera with an
exposure time of 255 seconds. The view back towards Neptune at a [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) of 135 degrees found the two known rings to
be five to 10 times brighter than seen in backscattering during Voyager
approach at much lower [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle). This
brightness increase implies a large percentage of microscopic particles within
the rings. Although the dominant arc-like clump of the outer ring is not seen
here, the inner ring appears brighter than the outer ring at the longitudes
seen in this image. A faint sheet of material is also revealed that extends
from the faint ring at a radius of 53,200 kilometers (33,000 miles). A new and
even fainter ring was discovered in this image at about 41,000 kilometers
(25,400 miles), seen running from the lower left corner to about one-third the
way across the top of the frame. This ring is quite broad, about 2,500
kilometers (1,550 miles) in radial width. In contrast to the two previously
discovered rings, this feature is quite diffuse and has no well defined radial
boundaries. The Voyager imaging experiment has now detected ring material in
all of the radial regions in which it has been detected by groundbased stellar
[occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiments. The Voyager spacecraft
was 720,000 kilometers (446,400 miles) from Neptune at the time of this
exposure. The Voyager Mission is conducted by JPL for NASA's Office of Space
Science and Applications.
