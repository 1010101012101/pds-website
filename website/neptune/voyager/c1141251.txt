Neptune's Rings

Three arcs of Neptune's outermost ring.

Two of Neptune's narrow rings are visible as arches above the crescent
planet. The inner ring, LeVerrier, is uniform but the outer ring, Adams,
contains three visible arcs.  The arcs are designated, from bottom to
top, Liberte, Egalite and Fraternite.  A smaller arc, Courage, leads the
other three but falls outside this field of view.  Voyager 2 acquired
this image as it encountered Neptune in August of 1989.
