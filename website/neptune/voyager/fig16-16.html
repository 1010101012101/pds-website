**Caption:**

A pair of Voyager 2 portraits of Neptune's ring system, which appears backlit
by feeble sunlight. The ring arcs seen in _Figure 17_ were not captured in
either of these images; by unfortunate coincidence they were taken on the
opposite side of the planet when these frames were taken 1.5 hours apart.
