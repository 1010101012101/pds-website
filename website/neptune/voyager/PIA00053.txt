Neptune Rings and 1989N2

The two main rings of Neptune and a moon.

In this Voyager wide-angle image taken on Aug. 23 1989, the two main
rings of Neptune can be clearly seen. In the lower part of the frame
the originally announced ring arc, consisting of three distinct
features, is visible. This feature covers about 35 degrees of
longitude and has yet to be radially resolved in Voyager images. From
higher resolution images it is known that this region contains much
more material than the diffuse belts seen elsewhere in its orbit,
which seem to encircle the planet. This is consistent with the fact
that ground- based observations of stellar <A HREF="/glossary.html#occultation">occultations</A> by the rings
show them to be very broken and clumpy. The more sensitive wide-angle
camera is revealing more widely distributed but fainter material. Each
of these rings of material lies just outside of the orbit of a newly
discovered moon. One of these moons, 1989N2, may be seen in the upper
right corner. The moon is streaked by its orbital motion, whereas the
stars in the frame are less smeared. The dark area around the bright
moon and star are artifacts of the processing required to bring out
the faint rings. This wide-angle image was taken from a range of 2
million kilometers (1.2 million miles), through the clear filter. The
Voyager Mission is conducted by JPL for NASA's Office of Space Science
and Applications.
