Rings Backlit

A pair of Voyager 2 portraits of Neptune's ring system.

A pair of Voyager 2 portraits of Neptune's ring system,
which appears backlit by feeble sunlight.  The ring arcs seen in <i>Figure
17</i> were not captured in either of these images; by unfortunate
coincidence they were taken on the opposite side of the planet when these
frames were taken 1.5 hours apart.
