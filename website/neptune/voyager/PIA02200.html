**Caption:**

One of two new ring arcs, or partial rings, discovered today by NASA's
Voyager 2 spacecraft, is faintly visible here just outside the orbit
of the Neptunian moon 1989N4, also discovered by Voyager 2 earlier
this month.  The 155 second exposure taken by Voyager's narrow-angle
camera shows the glare of an overexposed Neptune to the right of the
moon and ring arc.  The two bright streaks below the moon and ring arc
are stars.  The ring arc is approximately 50,000 kilometers (or 30,000
miles) long.  (The second ring arc, not apparent here, is
approximately 10,000 kilometers (6,000 miles) long and is associated
with the moon 1989N3.)  The ring arc, along with 1989N4, orbits about
62,000 kilometers (38,000 miles) from the planet's center, or about
37,000 kilometers (23,000 miles) from the planet's cloud tops.
Astronomers have long suspected the existence of such an irregular
ring system around Neptune.  Data from repeated ground based
observations hinted at the existence of irregular strands of partial
rings orbiting Neptune.  Voyager's photographs of the ring arcs are
the first photographic evidence that such a ring system exists.
Voyager scientists said the ring arcs may be comprised of debris
associated with the nearby moons, or may be the remnants of moons that
have been torn apart or ground down through collisions.  Close-up
studies of the ring arcs by Voyager 2 in coming days should help
determine their composition.  The Voyager mission is conducted by the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science and
Applications.
