**Caption:**

This pair of Voyager 2 images ([FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 11446.21 and 11448.10), two 591-s
exposures obtained through the clear filter of the wide angle camera,
show the full ring system with the highest sensitivity. Visible in
this figure are the bright, narrow N53 and N63 rings, the diffuse N42
ring, and (faintly) the plateau outside of the N53 ring (with its
slight brightening near 57,500 km).

**Image Note:** PICNO 1557N2+001
