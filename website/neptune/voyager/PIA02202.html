**Caption: **

This pair of Voyager 2 images ([FDS](/glossary.html#fds) 11446.21 and
11448.10), two 591-s exposures obtained through the clear filter of the wide
angle camera, show the full ring system with the highest sensitivity. Visible
in this figure are the bright, narrow N53 and N63 rings, the diffuse N42 ring,
and (faintly) the plateau outside of the N53 ring (with its slight brightening
near 57,500 km).

**Image Note:**     PICNO 1557N2+001
