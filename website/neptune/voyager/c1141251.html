**Caption:**

Two of Neptune's narrow rings are visible as arches above the crescent planet.
The inner ring, LeVerrier, is uniform but the outer ring, Adams, contains
three visible arcs. The arcs are designated, from bottom to top, Liberte,
Egalite and Fraternite. A smaller arc, Courage, leads the other three but
falls outside this field of view. Voyager 2 acquired this image as it
encountered Neptune in August of 1989.
