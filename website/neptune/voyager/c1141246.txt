Twisted Rope

A closeup of the Fraternity arc.

<A HREF="/glossary.html#fds">FDS</A> 11412.46 looks like a twisted rope.
The rope "strands" are really
individual clumps that have smeared out during the 111 second exposure.
The clumps are only 0.5 to 0.8 degrees apart and are very difficult to
understand.
