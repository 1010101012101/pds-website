      Software Overview
      =================
        A set of subroutines for processing one-dimensional profiles
        of planetary rings, such as occultations and image scans. The
        tools may be used to interpolate geometry and calibration
        data, and to filter and resample data extracted from files in
        PDS format.

 Software Overview
 =================
    The Object Access Library (OAL) is a set of software routines
    for accessing data that meet the standards of the NASA Planetary
    Data System (PDS).

    New in this release are:

    OAL:
     - Added support for BIL format Qubes and removed previous
       limitations on Qubes with suffixes.
     - Added support for GIF files: an ODL tree for a GIF file is
       created on-the-fly by OaParseLabelFile, and OaReadImage can
       now read images whose ENCODING_TYPE = GIF. See specific
       documentation in OaGif.txt.  The file oa_gif.c should be
       added to your makefile.
     - Bug fixes.

    L3:
     - Added functions to get and set comment fields and filename
       field in OBJDESC and KEYWORD structures.
     - Added functions to aid writing of labels when the user wants
       portions of the ODL tree (^STRUCTURE and ^CATALOG inclusions)
       to be written to separate files:  OdlChangeExpansionFile,
       OdlExtractExpansionTree, updates to OdlPrintLabel.
     - Updated L3_UsersGuide.txt.

  Software Overview
  =================
   The Planetary Data System (PDS) Label Library Light (lablib3, L3)
   is an evolving set of routines written in C which can be used to
   read, process, and write PDS labels. The Label Library reads and
   writes labels in the Object Description Language (ODL). The Label
   Library may be linked with any program which must deal with PDS
   labels. It was developed in order to encourage others to use PDS
   labels, to make it easier to mass produce PDS labels, and provide
   a method for enforcing ODL standards. The Label Library is a
   linking library which can be assimilated into any C program. It has
   been tested using the SUN C, VAX/VMS C, and Borland C++ compilers.
   Label Library Light is a reimplementation of Label Library Version
   1.1 that is smaller and faster and that has a simpler function
   interface.
