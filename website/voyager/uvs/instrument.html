The UVS is a light meter that is sensitive to ultraviolet light. It determines
when certain atoms or ions are present, or when certain physical processes are
going on. The instrument looks for specific colors of ultraviolet light that
certain elements and compounds are known to emit.

The Sun emits a large range of colors of light. If sunlight passes through an
atmosphere, certain elements and molecules in the atmosphere will absorb very
specific frequencies of light. If the UVS, when looking at filtered sunlight,
notices the absence of any of these specific colors, then particulate elements
and/or compounds have been detected. This process is call identifying elements
or compounds by atomic absorption.

## UVS Science Objectives

  * To determine the scattering properties of the lower planetary atmospheres. 

  * To determine the distribution of constituents with height. 

  * To determine the extent and distribution of hydrogen corona of the planets and satellites. 

  * To investigate night airglow and auroral activity. 

  * To determine the UV scattering properties and optical depths of planetary rings. 

  * To search for emissions from the rings and from any ring "atmosphere".
