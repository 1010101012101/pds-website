## Other Voyager SPICE Kernels

SPICE kernels contain critical information about the geometry, pointing, and
timing of NASA's spacecrafts.

For more information about SPICE visit the home page of PDS's [Navigation and
Ancillary Information Facility](http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov) (NAIF).

## Leap Seconds Kernel (LSK)

This file tabulates leap seconds, allowing for the converson between Universal
Time and Ephemeris Time.

## Planetary Constants Kernel (PCK)

This file tabulates parameters about planetary bodies including names, sizes,
shapes and rotation models.

## Spacecraft Clock Kernels (SCLK)

This file records the relationship between the Voyager spacecraft clocks (also
known as the Flight Data System or FDS Count).

  * VG200008.tsc (Voyager 2): [Download](VG200008.tsc) [View](VG200008.txt)

Note that, in its most complete form, the Voyager FDS Count is written as
follows:

`p/hhhhh:mm:sss` where

`hhhhh` is the "FDS hour", ranging from 0 to 65535. One FDS hour equals 48
actual minutes. Because of the limit of 65536, the clock turns over
approximately every 6 years.

`p` is the "partition number", which was incremented each time the clock
turned over. The partition number was 2 at Jupiter and Saturn, 3 at Uranus,
and 4 at Neptune.

`mm` is the "FDS minute", ranging from 0 to 59. One FDS minute equals 48
actual seconds.

`sss` is the "FDS second", ranging from 1 to 800 (**not** 0 to 799). One FDS
second equals 0.06 actual seconds.

## Frames Kernels (FK)

These files document the relationship between the fields of view of the
different instruments on the scan platform. Note that you will need the frames
kernel in order to use any of the C (pointing) kernels provided.

## Instrument Kernels (IK)

These files document the shapes, sizes and pixel dimensions of various
instrument fields of view.
