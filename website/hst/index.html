# HST Data at the PDS Rings Node

The Rings Node currently archives three collections of data obtained by the
HST. We intend to add a fourth collection, data obtained during the 2007/2008
Uranian Ring Plane Crossing season, as that data becomes available. The three
collections currently available are:

  * Observations of the Outer Planets from ACS, WFPC2, and WFC3.

  * Small Satellite Astrometry data,

  * Saturn 1995 Ring Plane Crossing data.

### HST Observations of the Outer Planets

HST provides some of our finest Earth-based data on the outer planets.
Literally hundreds of planetary programs have been carried out using HST. All
HST products can be found in the Multimission Archive at STScI,
[MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/index.html), and can be calibrated on-the-fly
prior to retrieval using the most current calibration files and algorithims.

Although the files are reliably archived, the STScI search interface is not
well adapted to planetary queries. In order to incorporate this rich data
collection into the search data base for our planetary science specific search
tool, **[OPUS**](http://pds-rings-tools.seti.org/opus/), the Rings Node has
developed a series of PDS compliant "data sets" of all HST observations of the
Outer Planets using ACS, WFPC2, or WFC3 obtained since the initial Hubble
repair mission.

Although these "data sets" are PDS compliant, since their primary function is
to support OPUS and since STScI periodically improves their calibration
pipeline, our "data sets"

    * **have not undergone a PDS peer review, and 
    * do not contain the final calibrated versions of the data files.**

We have placed all of these "data sets" on-line for browsing and direct
download, but please note the caveats above.

The "data sets", have been sorted into three volume set collections \- one for
each instrument. Within an instrument's volume set collection, each "data set"
corresponds to a single HST proposal.

Each "data set" contains detailed indices, TIFF and JPEG 'browse' versions of
each image accompanied by a simple text file containing all FITS header
information from the original image, and a PDS label file which includes
specific instructions for obtaining the calibrated version of the image from
STScI.

We anticipate having these "data sets" incorportated into **[OPUS**](http
://pds-rings-tools.seti.org/opus/) early in calendar year 2014. At that time,
users will be able to tailor a search of our HST data by target and
instrument, and will be able to apply a wide variety of observational and
geometric constraints to the search.

The on-line directories are organized by instrument and proposal number.
Directory names are in the form HST#x_xxxx, where # is replaced by a single
letter that indicates which instrument obtained the data. We use the same
letter identifiers for the instruments as STScI, "I" = WFC3; "J" = ACS; "U" =
"WFPC2". These are available for directory tree browsing, or for downloading
as separate tar.gz files for each "data set". For information on opening files
of this type, click [here](/targzip.htm).

    * WFC3 -   **[Browsable Volumes**](/vol/HSTIx_xxxx/),    **[downloadable tar.gz files**](/archives/HSTUx_xxxx/)

    * ACS -      **[Browsable Volumes**](/vol/HSTJx_xxxx/),    **[downloadable tar.gz files**](/archives/HSTJx_xxxx/)

    * WFPC2 - **[Browsable Volumes**](/vol/HSTUx_xxxx/),    **[downloadable tar.gz files**](/archives/HSTUx_xxxx/)

### Small Satellite Astrometry

The Rings Node currently has two volumes of astrometric HST data for the small
satellites of Saturn. For more information about and links to the data, see
[Satellite Astrometry.](/astrometry/)

### Saturn Ring Plane Crossing (SRPX)

The Rings Node currently has nine volumes of SRPX data of which the first five
volumes were obtained by the HST. For more information on the SRPX seasons,
the information about and links to the associated data and links to relevant
web sites, see [Saturn RPX.](/rpx/)

### Uranus Ring Plane Crossing (URPX)

The Rings Node currently has no data from the URPX observing campaign. We do
anticipate receiving and archiving such data as it becomes available. For more
information on the URPX seasons and links to relevant web sites, see [Uranian
RPX.](/urpx/)
