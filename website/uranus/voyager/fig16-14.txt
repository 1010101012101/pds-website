In a Different Light

See how lighting affects the appearance of the Uranian ring system.

Compare these images of the Uranian ring system.
Voyager 2 acquired the upper one the day before it passed Uranus
in January 1986; at the time sunlight striking the ring particles
was reflected back toward the camera.  Computer enhancement
makes the rings appear much brighter than they really are.  (To see
the faint lambda ring, put your eye close to the page bottom and look
toward the arrow.)  In the lower image, taken somewhat later,
Voyager 2 was looking almost directly back toward the Sun's
direction (the phase angle is 172.5 deg).  This backlighting of the
rings dramatically enhanced the visibility of any micron-size dust
particles they contain.  Voyager 2's motion during the exposure
caused some smearing of the detail, especially near the bottom
edge.  The nine rings discovered from Earth can be discerned with
relative ease (note the poor segment match for the markedly
eccentric epsilon ring).  However, many other ringlets visible here do not
correspond to known features in the system.
