**Caption:**

This silhouetted image of the rings of Uranus was taken by the Voyager
2 spacecraft on Jan. 24, 1986, just 27 minutes before its closest
approach to the planet.  A half-second exposure was made with the
wide-angle camera at a distance of 63,300 kilometers (39,300 miles).
This image shows the nine originally known rings appearing as dark
lines against the brighter clouds of the planet.  The most prominent
ring, called epsilon, appears at top; barely visible at bottom are the
three rings known simply as 4, 5 and 6.  The Uranian rings are
extremely dark.  The unique geometry of this view -- with the rings
against a bright background -- was chosen to ensure that an image
could be obtained with a relatively fast exposure.  The relative
widths and spacing of the rings appear slightly different from other
views because of the effects of forshortening and ring inclinations.
The resolution of the image is about 9 km (5 miles).  The Voyager
project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

**Image Note:** PICNO 1766U2-001
