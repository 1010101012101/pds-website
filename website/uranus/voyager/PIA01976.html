Voyager 2 has discovered two ["shepherd"
satellites](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) associated with the rings of
Uranus. The two moons -- designated 1986U7 and 1986U8 -- are seen here on
either side of the bright epsilon ring; all nine of the known Uranian rings
are visible. The image was taken Jan. 21, 1986, at a distance of 4.1 million
kilometers (2.5 million miles) and resolution of about 36 km (22 mi). The
image was processed to enhance narrow features. The epsilon ring appears
surrounded by a dark halo as a result of this processing; occasional blips
seen on the ring are also artifacts. Lying inward from the epsilon ring are
the delta, gamma and eta rings; then the beta and alpha rings; and finally the
barely visible 4, 5 and 6 rings. The rings have been studied since their
discovery in 1977, through observations of how they diminish the light of
stars they pass in front of. This image is the first direct observation of all
nine rings in reflected sunlight. They range in width from about 1OO km (6O
mi) at the widest part of the epsilon ring to only a few kilometers for most
of the others. The discovery of the two ring moons 1986U7 and 1986U8 is a
major advance in our understanding of the structure of the Uranian rings and
is in good agreement with theoretical predictions of how these narrow rings
are kept from spreading out. Based on likely surface brightness properties,
the moons are of roughly 2O- and 3O-km diameter, respectively. The Voyager
project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

**Image Note:**     PICNO 1474U2-004     1986U7 is now called Cordelia; 1986U8 is now called Ophelia
