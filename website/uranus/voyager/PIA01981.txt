Rings of Uranus

Rings image with resolution of about 1O km (6 mi).

This Voyager 2 image of the Uranian rings delta, gamma, eta, beta and
alpha (from top) was taken Jan. 23, 1986.  The spacecraft was 1.12
million kilometers (69O,OOO miles) away when its narrow- angle camera
obtained this clear-filter view.  This image illustrates the broad
outer component and narrow inner component of the eta ring, which
orbits Uranus at a radius of some 47,OOO km (29,OOO mi).  The broad
component is considerably more transparent than the dense, narrow
inner eta component, as well as the other narrow rings shown.
Resolution here is about 1O km (6 mi).  The Voyager project is managed
for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
