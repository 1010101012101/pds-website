**Caption:**

Compare these images of the Uranian ring system. Voyager 2 acquired the upper
one the day before it passed Uranus in January 1986; at the time sunlight
striking the ring particles was reflected back toward the camera. Computer
enhancement makes the rings appear much brighter than they really are. (To see
the faint lambda ring, put your eye close to the page bottom and look toward
the arrow.) In the lower image, taken somewhat later, Voyager 2 was looking
almost directly back toward the Sun's direction (the phase angle is 172.5
deg). This backlighting of the rings dramatically enhanced the visibility of
any micron-size dust particles they contain. Voyager 2's motion during the
exposure caused some smearing of the detail, especially near the bottom edge.
The nine rings discovered from Earth can be discerned with relative ease (note
the poor segment match for the markedly eccentric epsilon ring). However, many
other ringlets visible here do not correspond to known features in the system.
