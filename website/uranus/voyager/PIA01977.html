**Caption:**

Epsilon, delta, gamma, eta, beta, alpha, 4, 5 and 6 rings.

Voyager 2 returned this picture of the Uranus rings on Jan. 22, 1986,
from a distance of 2.52 million kilometers (1.56 million miles).  All
nine known rings are visible in this image, a 15- second exposure
through the clear filter on Voyager's narrow- angle camera.  The rings
are quite dark and very narrow.  The most prominent and outermost of
the nine, called epsilon, is seen at top.  The next three in toward
Uranus -- called delta, gamma and eta -- are much fainter and more
narrow than the epsilon ring.  Then come the beta and alpha rings and
finally the innermost grouping, known simply as the 4, 5 and 6 rings.
The last three are very faint and are at the limit of detection for
the Voyager camera.  Uranus' rings range in width from about 1OO km
(6O mi) at the widest part of the epsilon ring to only a few
kilometers for most of the others.  This image was processed to
enhance these narrow features; the bright dots are imperfections on
the camera detector.  The resolution scale is approximately 5O km (3O
mi).  The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
