Epsilon ring

High-resolution image of the epsilon ring of Uranus.

Voyager 2 acquired this high-resolution image of the epsilon ring of
Uranus on Jan. 23, 1986, from a distance of 1.12 million kilometers
(69O,OOO miles).  This clear-filter image from Voyager's narrow-angle
camera has a resolution of about 1O km (6 mi).  The epsilon ring,
approximately 1OO km (6O mi) wide at this location, clearly shows a
structural variation.  Visible here are a broad, bright outer
component about 4O km (25 mi) wide; a darker middle region of
comparable width; and a narrow, bright inner strip about 15 km (9 mi)
wide.  The epsilon-ring structure seen by Voyager is similar to that
observed from the ground with stellar-<A HREF="/glossary.html#occultation">occultation</A> techniques.  This
frame represents the first Voyager image that resolves these features
within the epsilon ring.  The occasional fuzzy splotches on the outer
and inner parts of the ring are artifacts left by the removal of
<A HREF="/glossary.html#reseau">reseau</A> marks (used for making measurements on the image).  The Voyager
project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
