**Caption: **

A newly discovered tenth ring of Uranus is barely visible near the top of this
two-frame Voyager 2 mosaic. The frames composing this picture were obtained
Jan. 23, 1986, from a distance of 1.12 million kilometers (690,000 miles). The
tenth ring is about midway between the bright, outermost epsilon ring and the
next ring down, called delta. The tenth ring, the first such feature
discovered by Voyager, orbits Uranus at a radius of about 50,000 km (30,000
mi). This places the ring close to the orbit of the recently discovered
['shepherd' satellite](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) 1986U7. All nine of
the previously known rings of Uranus are visible: epsilon, delta, gamma, eta,
beta, alpha, 4, 5 and 6 (from top). This image has been processed to enhance
narrow features; the resolution is roughly 10 km (6 mi). Both a bright, narrow
inner component and a fainter, extended outer component of the eta ring are
distinct in this view. The epsilon ring -- which at this location achieves its
maximum width of 100 km (60 mi) -- and the broad component of the eta ring are
the only features resolved here. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
