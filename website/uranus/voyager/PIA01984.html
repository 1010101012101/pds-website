**Caption: **

Voyager 2 took this wide-angle image of Uranus' rings as the spacecraft neared
the plane of the rings less than an hour before closest approach to the
planet. Voyager obtained this clear- filter image on Jan. 24, 1986, from a
distance of about 117,OOO kilometers (73,OOO miles) from Uranus; resolution is
about 16 km (1O mi). Running diagonally from upper left to lower center are
the four sets of previously known discrete rings. Barely visible to the right
of these appears the [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa) of a very broad, faint ring
not seen before. (The [ansa](/glossary.html#ansa) is the portion of a ring
visible on either side of a planet when viewed from a distance.) This inner
ring extends about 3,OOO km (1,9OO mi) in width and is located approximately
1,5OO km (9OO mi) inside the innermost of the previously known discrete rings,
the 6 ring. These figures place the inner edge of the newly found ring about
11,OOO km (7,OOO mi) above the cloudtops of Uranus. Since the ring is so
faint, this image has been extensively processed, resulting in the blurry,
patchy appearance. The diagram at right shows the positions of the inner ring
and the four outer sets of rings. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
