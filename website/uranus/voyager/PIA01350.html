**Caption: **

The outer rings of Uranus are visible in this Voyager 2 image, obtained Jan.
23, 1986, from a distance of 1.44 million kilometers (89O,OOO miles). The
outermost and brightest ring, called epsilon, is visible along with the
fainter and narrower delta and gamma rings (from left). This clear-filter,
15-second exposure was shuttered by Voyager's narrow-angle camera. The
resolution of this image is about 15 km (9 mi). The epsilon ring is resolved
into two bright components separated by a darker lane of material. Voyager
scientists believe this is caused by a thinning of the ring material away from
the edges of the ring. This image was part of a sequence of pictures designed
to search for moons orbiting within the rings and responsible for their narrow
appearance. One of two such ["shepherd"
moons](/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite) discovered by Voyager -- found Jan.
2O and designated 1986U7 -- is visible as the elongated bright feature midway
between the epsilon and delta rings. The moon appears elongated because its
orbital motion smeared its image during the long exposure. The Voyager project
is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
