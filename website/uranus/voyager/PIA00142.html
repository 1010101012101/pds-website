**Caption:**

This dramatic Voyager 2 picture reveals a continuous
distribution of small particles throughout the Uranus ring system Voyager
took this image while in the shadow of Uranus, at a distance of 236,000
kilometers (142,000 miles and a resolution of about 33 km (20 ml). This
unique geometry -- the highest [phase angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) at which Voyager imaged the
rings -- allows us to see lanes of fine dust particles not visible from
other viewing angles. All the previously known rings are visible here
however, some of the brighest feature in the image are bright dust lanes
not previously seen. The combination of this unique geometry and a long,
96 second exposure allowed this spectacular observation, acquired through
the clear filter of Voyager's wide-angle camera The long exposure
produced a noticeable, non-uniform smear as well as streaks due to
trailed stars. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
