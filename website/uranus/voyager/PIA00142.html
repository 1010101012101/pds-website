**Caption: **

This dramatic Voyager 2 picture reveals a continuous distribution of small
particles throughout the Uranus ring system Voyager took this image while in
the shadow of Uranus, at a distance of 236,000 kilometers (142,000 miles and a
resolution of about 33 km (20 ml). This unique geometry -- the highest [phase
angle](/glossary.html#phase_angle) at which Voyager imaged the rings -- allows
us to see lanes of fine dust particles not visible from other viewing angles.
All the previously known rings are visible here however, some of the brighest
feature in the image are bright dust lanes not previously seen. The
combination of this unique geometry and a long, 96 second exposure allowed
this spectacular observation, acquired through the clear filter of Voyager's
wide-angle camera The long exposure produced a noticeable, non-uniform smear
as well as streaks due to trailed stars. The Voyager project is managed for
NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. **Image Note:**
