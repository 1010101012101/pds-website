Uranus Rings in False Color

False-color view of nine rings of Uranus.

This false-color view of the rings of Uranus was made from images
taken by Voyager 2 on Jan. 21, 1986, from a distance of 4.17 million
kilometers (2.59 million miles). All nine known rings are visible
here; the somewhat fainter, pastel lines seen between them are
contributed by the computer enhancement. Six 15-second narrow-angle
images were used to extract color information from the extremely dark
and faint rings. Two images each in the green, clear and violet
filters were added together and averaged to find the proper color
differences between the rings. The final image was made from these
three color averages and represents an enhanced, false-color view. The
image shows that the brightest, or epsilon, ring at top is neutral in
color, with the fainter eight other rings showing color differences
between them. Moving down, toward Uranus, we see the delta, gamma and
eta rings in shades of blue and green; the beta and alpha rings in
somewhat lighter tones; and then a final set of three, known simply as
the 4, 5 and 6 rings, in faint off- white tones. Scientists will use
this color information to try to understand the nature and origin of
the ring material. The resolution of this image is approximately 4O km
(25 mi). The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
