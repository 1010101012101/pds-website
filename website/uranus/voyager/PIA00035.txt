Uranus' Tenth Ring

Newly discovered tenth ring is barely visible near the top of this image.

A newly discovered tenth ring of Uranus is barely visible near the top
of this two-frame Voyager 2 mosaic. The frames composing this picture
were obtained Jan. 23, 1986, from a distance of 1.12 million
kilometers (690,000 miles). The tenth ring is about midway between the
bright, outermost epsilon ring and the next ring down, called
delta. The tenth ring, the first such feature discovered by Voyager,
orbits Uranus at a radius of about 50,000 km (30,000 mi). This places
the ring close to the orbit of the recently discovered <A HREF="/glossary.html#shepherd_satellite">'shepherd' satellite</A> 1986U7. All nine of the previously known rings of Uranus are
visible: epsilon, delta, gamma, eta, beta, alpha, 4, 5 and 6 (from
top). This image has been processed to enhance narrow features; the
resolution is roughly 10 km (6 mi). Both a bright, narrow inner
component and a fainter, extended outer component of the eta ring are
distinct in this view. The epsilon ring -- which at this location
achieves its maximum width of 100 km (60 mi) -- and the broad
component of the eta ring are the only features resolved here. The
Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
