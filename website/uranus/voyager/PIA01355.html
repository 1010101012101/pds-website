**Caption:**

View of rings just 11 minutes before passing through the ring plane.

Voyager 2's wide-angle camera captured this view of the outer part of
the Uranian ring system the morning of Jan. 24, 1986, just 11 minutes
before passing through the ring plane. The spacecraft was 125,OOO
kilometers (78,OOO miles) away when it obtained this clear-filter
view; the resolution is slightly better than 9 km (6 mi). The
brightest, outermost ring is known as epsilon. Interior to epsilon lie
(from top) the newly discovered 1Oth ring of Uranus -- designated
1986UR1 and barely visible here -- and then the delta, gamma and eta
rings. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
