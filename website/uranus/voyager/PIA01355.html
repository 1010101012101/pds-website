**Caption: **

Voyager 2's wide-angle camera captured this view of the outer part of the
Uranian ring system the morning of Jan. 24, 1986, just 11 minutes before
passing through the ring plane. The spacecraft was 125,OOO kilometers (78,OOO
miles) away when it obtained this clear-filter view; the resolution is
slightly better than 9 km (6 mi). The brightest, outermost ring is known as
epsilon. Interior to epsilon lie (from top) the newly discovered 1Oth ring of
Uranus -- designated 1986UR1 and barely visible here -- and then the delta,
gamma and eta rings. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
