   Rings Uranus has a system of narrow, faint rings. Ring particles are dark, which is
   consistent with rocky or carbonaceous material. 

Uranus Images

Black Rings

 The rings of Uranus are nearly black with a reflectivity (albedo) of
only a few percent. Virtually invisible from the Earth, the rings were
discovered by watching stars dim and brighten as the spacecraft flew by
Uranus. This image was taken by Voyager 2 looking back toward the sun
through the ring system. The rings appear to be extremely dusty, though
rich in fine particles. The short stubby streaks are stars slightly
smeared during the exposure. 

Rings in False Color

                      The 9 known rings of Uranus are visible here. The
somewhat fainter, pastel lines seen between the rings are artifacts of
computer enhancement. Six narrow-angle images were used to extract color
information from the extremely dark and faint rings. The final image was
made from three color averages and represents an enhanced, false-color
view. The image shows that the brightest, or epsilon ring at top is
neutral in color, with the fainter 8 remaining rings showing color
differences between them. 

Shepherd Satellites

                  The discovery of two shepherd satellites has advanced
our understanding of the structure of the Uranian rings. The moons,
designated 1986U7 and 1986U8, are seen here on either side of the bright
epsilon ring; all 9 of the known Uranian rings are also visible. The
epsilon ring appears surrounded by a dark halo as a result of image
processing; occasional blips seen on the ring are also artifacts. Lying
inward from the epsilon ring are the delta, gamma and eta rings; the
beta and alpha rings; and finally the barely visible 4, 5 and 6 rings.
The rings have been studied since their discovery in 1977.
