Hubble Captures Detailed Image of Uranus' Atmosphere

This false color image also shows the planet's rings.

Hubble Space Telescope has peered deep into Uranus' atmosphere to see
clear and hazy layers created by a mixture of gases.  Using infrared
filters, Hubble captured detailed features of three layers of Uranus'
atmosphere.

Hubble's images are different from the ones taken by the Voyager 2
spacecraft, which flew by Uranus 10 years ago.  Those images - not
taken in infrared light - showed a greenish-blue disk with very little
detail.

The infrared image allows astronomers to probe the structure of
Uranus' atmosphere, which consists of mostly hydrogen with traces of
methane. The red around the planet's edge represents a very thin haze
at a high altitude. The haze is so thin that it can only be seen by
looking at the edges of the disk, and is similar to looking at the
edge of a soap bubble. The yellow near the bottom of Uranus is another
hazy layer. The deepest layer, the blue near the top of Uranus, shows
a clearer atmosphere.

<P>

Image processing has been used to brighten the rings around Uranus so
that astronomers can study their structure. In reality, the rings are
as dark as black lava or charcoal.

This false color picture was assembled from several exposures taken
July 3, 1995 by the Wide Field Planetary Camera-2.
