**Caption:**

This series of images from NASA's Hubble Space Telescope shows how the ring
system around the distant planet Uranus appears at ever more oblique
(shallower) tilts as viewed from Earth - culminating in the rings being seen
edge-on in three observing opportunities in 2007. The best of these events
appears in the far right image taken with Hubble's Wide Field Planetary Camera
2 on August 14, 2007.

The edge-on rings appear as two spikes above and below the planet. The rings
cannot be seen running fully across the face of the planet because the bright
glare of the planet has been blocked out in the Hubble photo (a small amount
of residual glare appears as a fan- shaped image artifact). A much shorter
color exposure of the planet has been photo- composited to show its size and
position relative to the ring plane.

Earthbound astronomers only see the rings' edge every 42 years as the planet
follows a leisurely 84-year orbit about the Sun. However, the last time the
rings were tilted edge-on to Earth astronomers didn't even know they existed.

With further analysis of the Hubble data, astronomer Mark Showalter of the
SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., hopes to detect some of the small
moons that may shepherd the debris into distinct rings.

Until Voyager 2 flew by Uranus in January 1986, the rings were only known from
the way they temporarily blocked the light of stars passing behind the planet.
Hubble provided some of the first images of the ring system as viewed from
Earth's distance of approximately 2 billion miles. The advent of adaptive
optics gave ground-based observers using large telescopes comparatively sharp
views.

The rings were discovered in 1977, so this is the first time for a Uranus ring
crossing to be observed from Earth. Earth's orbit around the Sun permits three
opportunities to view the rings edge-on: Uranus made its first ring crossing
as seen from Earth on May 3; it made its second crossing on August 16; and
will cross for the third time on February 20, 2008. Though the last ring
crossing relative to Earth will be hidden behind the Sun, most of Earth's
premier telescopes, including Keck, Hubble, the European Southern
Observatory's Very Large Telescope and the Hale Telescope on Mt. Palomar, plan
to focus on the planet again in the days following December 7, 2007. On
December 7 the rings will be perfectly edge-on to the Sun.

Showalter is a member of a team led by Imke de Pater of the University of
California, Berkeley, who reported that the rings of micron-sized dust have
changed significantly since the Voyager 2 spacecraft photographed the Uranus
system 21 years ago. Observations were also gleaned from near-infrared
adaptive optics observations with the Keck II telescope on May 28, 2007, and
reported in an article appearing on August 23 in Science Express, the online
edition of Science Magazine.
