**Caption:**

This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the planet Uranus reveals the
planet's rings, at least five of the inner moons, and bright clouds in the
planet's southern hemisphere. Hubble now allows astronomers to revisit the
planet at a level of detail not possible since the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew
by the planet briefly, nearly a decade ago.

Hubble's new view was obtained on August 14, 1994, when Uranus was 1.7 billion
miles (2.8 billion kilometers) from Earth. Similar details, as imaged by the
Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, were only previously seen by the Voyager 2
spacecraft that flew by Uranus in 1986 (the rings were discovered by stellar
[occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiments in 1977, but not seen
directly until Voyager flew to Uranus). Since the flyby, none of these inner
satellites has been observed further, and detailed observations of the rings
and Uranus' atmosphere have not been possible, because the rings are lost in
the planet's glare as seen through ground-based optical telescopes.

Each of the inner moons appears as a string of three dots in this picture
because it is a composite of three images, taken about six minutes apart. When
these images are combined, they show the motion of the moons compared with the
sky background. Because the moons move much more rapidly than our own Moon,
they change position noticeably over only a few minutes. (These multiple
images also help to distinguish the moons from stars and imaging detector
artifacts, i.e., cosmic rays and electronic noise).

Thanks to Hubble's capabilities, astronomers will now be able to determine the
orbits more precisely. With this increase in accuracy, astronomers can better
probe the unusual dynamics of Uranus' complicated satellite system. Measuring
the moons' brightness in several colors might offer clues to the satellites'
origin by providing new information on their mineralogical composition.
Similar measurements of the rings should yield new insights into their
composition and origin.

One of the four gas giant planets of our solar system, Uranus is largely
featureless. HST does reveal a high altitude haze which appears as a bright
"cap" above the planet's south pole, along with clouds at southern latitudes
(similar structures were observed by Voyager). Unlike Earth, Uranus' south
pole points toward the Sun during part of the planet's 84-year orbit. Thanks
to its high resolution and ability to make observations over many years,
Hubble can follow seasonal changes in Uranus' atmosphere, which should be
unusual given the planet's large tilt.

These observations were conducted by a team led by Dr. Ken Seidelmann of the
U.S. Naval Observatory as Principal Investigator. These images have been
processed by Professor Douglas Currie and Mr. Dan Dowling in the Department of
Physics at the University of Maryland. Other team members are Dr. Ben Zellner
at Georgia Southern University, Dr. Dan Pascu and Mr. Jim Rhode at the U.S.
Naval Observatory, and Dr. Ed Wells, Mr. Charles Kowal (Computer Science
Corporation) and Dr. Alex Storrs of the Space Telescope Science Institute.
