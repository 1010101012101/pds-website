Several of Uranus' rings, including the outermost Epsilon ring.

This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the planet Uranus reveals
the planet's rings and bright clouds and a high altitude haze above
the planet's south pole.

Hubble's new view was obtained on August 14, 1994, when Uranus was 1.7
billion miles (2.8 billion kilometers) from Earth. These details, as
imaged by the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, were only previously seen
by the Voyager 2 spacecraft, which flew by Uranus in 1986. Since then,
none of these inner satellites has been further observed, and detailed
observations of the rings have not been possible.

Though Uranus' rings were discovered indirectly in 1977 (through
stellar <A HREF="/glossary.html#occultation">occultation</A> observations), they have never before been seen in
visible light through a ground-based telescope.

Hubble resolves several of Uranus' rings, including the outermost
Epsilon ring.  The planet has a total of 11 concentric rings of dark
dust. Uranus is tipped such that its rotation axis lies in the plane
of its orbit, so the rings appear nearly face-on.

Three of Uranus' inner moons each appear as a string of three dots at
the bottom of the picture. This is because the picture is a composite
of three images, taken about six minutes apart, and then combined to
show the moons' orbital motions. The satellites are, from left to
right, Cressida, Juliet, and Portia. The moons move much more rapidly
than our own Moon does as it moves around the Earth, so they
noticeably change position over only a few minutes.

One of the four gas giant planets of our solar system, Uranus is
largely featureless. HST does resolve a high altitude haze which
appears as a bright 'cap' above the planet's south pole, along with
clouds at southern latitudes (similar structures were observed by
Voyager). Unlike Earth, Uranus' south pole points toward the Sun
during part of the planet's 84-year orbit. Thanks to its high
resolution and ability to make observations over many years, Hubble
can follow seasonal changes in Uranus's atmosphere, which should be
unusual given the planet's large tilt.
