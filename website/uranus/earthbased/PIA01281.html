This NASA Hubble Space Telescope reveals Uranus' rings and inner moons.

This NASA Hubble Space Telescope image of the planet Uranus reveals
the planet's rings, at least five of the inner moons, and bright
clouds in the planet's southern hemisphere. Hubble now allows
astronomers to revisit the planet at a level of detail not possible
since the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew by the planet briefly, nearly a
decade ago.

Hubble's new view was obtained on August 14, 1994, when Uranus was 1.7
billion miles (2.8 billion kilometers) from Earth. Similar details, as
imaged by the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2, were only previously seen
by the Voyager 2 spacecraft that flew by Uranus in 1986 (the rings
were discovered by stellar [occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiments in 1977, but not
seen directly until Voyager flew to Uranus). Since the flyby, none of
these inner satellites has been observed further, and detailed
observations of the rings and Uranus' atmosphere have not been
possible, because the rings are lost in the planet's glare as seen
through ground-based optical telescopes.

Each of the inner moons appears as a string of three dots in this
picture because it is a composite of three images, taken about six
minutes apart. When these images are combined, they show the motion of
the moons compared with the sky background. Because the moons move
much more rapidly than our own Moon, they change position noticeably
over only a few minutes. (These multiple images also help to
distinguish the moons from stars and imaging detector artifacts, i.e.,
cosmic rays and electronic noise).

Thanks to Hubble's capabilities, astronomers will now be able to
determine the orbits more precisely. With this increase in accuracy,
astronomers can better probe the unusual dynamics of Uranus'
complicated satellite system. Measuring the moons' brightness in
several colors might offer clues to the satellites' origin by
providing new information on their mineralogical composition. Similar
measurements of the rings should yield new insights into their
composition and origin.

One of the four gas giant planets of our solar system, Uranus is
largely featureless. HST does reveal a high altitude haze which
appears as a bright 'cap' above the planet's south pole, along with
clouds at southern latitudes (similar structures were observed by
Voyager). Unlike Earth, Uranus' south pole points toward the Sun
during part of the planet's 84- year orbit. Thanks to its high
resolution and ability to make observations over many years, Hubble
can follow seasonal changes in Uranus' atmosphere, which should be
unusual given the planet's large tilt.
