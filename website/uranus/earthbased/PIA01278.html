Taking its first peek at Uranus, NASA Hubble Space Telescope's Near Infrared
Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) has detected six distinct clouds
in images taken July 28,1997.

The image on the right, taken 90 minutes after the left-hand image, shows the
planet's rotation. Each image is a composite of three near-infrared images.
They are called false-color images because the human eye cannot detect
infrared light. Therefore, colors corresponding to visible light were assigned
to the images. (The wavelengths for the 'blue,' 'green,' and 'red' exposures
are 1.1, 1.6, and 1.9 micrometers, respectively.)

At visible and near-infrared light, sunlight is reflected from hazes and
clouds in the atmosphere of Uranus. However, at near-infrared light,
absorption by gases in the Uranian atmosphere limits the view to different
altitudes, causing intense contrasts and colors.

In these images, the blue exposure probes the deepest atmospheric levels. A
blue color indicates clear atmospheric conditions, prevalent at mid-latitudes
near the center of the disk. The green exposure is sensitive to absorption by
methane gas, indicating a clear atmosphere; but in hazy atmospheric regions,
the green color is seen because sunlight is reflected back before it is
absorbed. The green color around the south pole (marked by '+') shows a strong
local haze. The red exposure reveals absorption by hydrogen, the most abundant
gas in the atmosphere of Uranus. Most sunlight shows patches of haze high in
the atmosphere. A red color near the limb (edge) of the disk indicates the
presence of a high- altitude haze. The purple color to the right of the
equator also suggests haze high in the atmosphere with a clear atmosphere
below.

The five clouds visible near the right limb rotated counterclockwise during
the time between both images. They reach high into the atmosphere, as
indicated by their red color. Features of such high contrast have never been
seen before on Uranus. The clouds are almost as large as continents on Earth,
such as Europe. Another cloud (which barely can be seen) rotated along the
path shown by the black arrow. It is located at lower altitudes, as indicated
by its green color.

The rings of Uranus are extremely faint in visible light but quite prominent
in the near infrared. The brightest ring, the epsilon ring, has a variable
width around its circumference. Its widest and thus brightest part is at the
top in this image. Two fainter, inner rings are visible next to the epsilon
ring.

Eight of the 10 small Uranian satellites, discovered by Voyager 2, can be seen
in both images. Their sizes range from about 25 miles (40 kilometers) for
Bianca to 100 miles (150 kilometers) for Puck. The smallest of these
satellites have not been detected since the departure of Voyager 2 from Uranus
in 1986. These eight satellites revolve around Uranus in less than a day. The
inner ones are faster than the outer ones. Their motion in the 90 minutes
between both images is marked in the right panel. The area outside the rings
was slightly enhanced in brightness to improve the visibility of these faint
satellites.
