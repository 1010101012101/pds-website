**Caption:**

These images, taken with the NASA Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for
Surveys (ACS), show several faint moons circling Uranus, including a newly
detected moon and a rediscovered satellite. The planet's ring system can also
be seen.

The arrow in the frame at right points to one of two newly discovered moons,
among the smallest moons yet found around Uranus. The moon is temporarily
designated as S/2003 U 1 until the International Astronomical Union (IAU)
formally approves its discovery. S/2003 U 1 is orbiting 60,600 miles (97,700
km) away from the planet. If the satellite is as dark as Uranus's other moons,
it is 10 miles (16 km) across, about the size of San Francisco. The Hubble
telescope spotted this moon orbiting between the moons Puck, the largest
satellite found by Voyager, and Miranda, the innermost of the five largest
Uranian satellites. Astronomers previously thought this region was empty
space. S/2003 U 1 whirls around the gas giant planet in 22 hours and 9
minutes.

The arrow in the frame at left points to a rediscovered moon orbiting 750
miles (1,200 km) away from the moon Belinda. The moon was detected in Voyager
images, but the finding needed confirmation by an Earth-based telescope. Some
astronomers think that S/1986 U 10 was once part of Belinda and broke off
during a collision with a comet. Once certified by the IAU, these new
discoveries will raise the number of Uranus moons to 24\. Thirteen of them
orbit even closer to Uranus than the five largest satellites, which are
hundreds of miles wide. The location of one of those five satellites, Miranda,
is shown in the image. The satellite itself cannot be seen because its bright
light has been blocked out.

Astronomers stretched the limit of the ACS to find the S/2003 U 1 and S/1986 U
10. The moons are 40 million times fainter than Uranus. Even with the high
resolution and sensitivity of the ACS, astronomers had to overexpose the
images of Uranus to pinpoint the moons.

The images were made from a series of exposures taken Aug. 25, 2003. In order
to show the faint moons in these images, the light from the much brighter
Uranus has been blocked out. A separate but much shorter exposure of Uranus
has been inserted into the images for reference. All the moons appear streaked
because they were moving in their orbits during the long exposures. The white
specks in the background are image artifacts.
