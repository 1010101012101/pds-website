AAREADME.TXT -- Updated 13-Dec-1994 by Mark Showalter

This directory contains the a set of event predictions and ephemeris
calculations derived by Dr. Philip Nicholson of Cornell University.  Included 
are 

The following files are included:

Geometry of the Earth and Sun crossings:
	MAY95.OUT	Earth crossing #1
	AUG95.OUT	Earth crossing #2
	NOV95.OUT	Sun crossing
	FEB96.OUT	Earth crossing #3
A header describes the format of these tabular files in detail.

	EPIMETHEUS_REA.TXT	Epimetheus reappearances
Eclipse disappearances occur between May 22 and Aug 10; reappearances occur
between Nov 21 and Feb 11, 1996.  There are 100-150 events in each set.  The
times are accurate to within a few minutes, subject to larger ephemeris errors
for Atlas and especially for Pan (about 1 hour).  All times are corrected for
mean light travel time, and are in UTC.  The Janus/Epimetheus ephemeris includes
the co-orbital libration model from Nicholson et al. (Icarus 100, p. 464, 1992);
the Pan ephemeris is based on Showalter (Nature 351, p. 709, 1991); the other
ephemerides are from JPL.  All assume circular orbits.  Nicholson has more
accurate predictions for individual dates, if needed, including the
eccentricities and inclinations, and instantaneous light time corrections.
