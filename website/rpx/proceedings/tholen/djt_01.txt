I. Calibration
    * timing should be good to better than a second to keep the systematic error
      smaller than the likely random error in the midevent time determination
        * GPS good to better than a millisecond
        * modem synchronization to NIST good to small fraction of a second
        * TCP/IP synchronization to NIST good to fraction of a second (not as
          good as modem due to irregular network delays
        * manual synchronization can be done to fraction of a second using WWV
          receiver
        * for longer events, be sure to measure clock drift
    * use two comparison stars for magnitude calibration
        * should be chosen to match colors of satellites reasonably well so that
          transformation errors are minimized
        * should be faint enough to avoid saturation or nonlinearity problems,
          but bright enough to minimize time spent on magnitude calibration
        * Titan itself may prove to be a useful calibrator for other satellites

II. Signal to Noise Ratio
    * most events are of short duration, so high speed devices are required to
      provide suitable time resolution, and large aperture is needed to provide
      adequate signal to noise ratio during each integration
        * high speed CCD is best
        * slow readout CCD might work if image drifted across chip (orthogonal
          to Saturn-satellite axis), though saturation may be a problem
        * high speed aperture photometer may work, though see below

III. Background Subtraction
    * two-dimensional detectors offer best prospects for accurate background
      subtraction
    * single element detectors can work, with some effort; possible techniques
      include:
        1. chopping to a point the same distance from Saturn: doesn't work, due
           to the complex brightness contours produced by the rings and
           diffraction bars
        2. measuring the background at several positions surrounding your
           object, such as to the north, south, east, and west: doesn't work,
           because the average of these is not usually the same as the
           background at your object
        3. chopping to a point diametrically opposite the center of Saturn: best
           bet for those who can't change aperture sizes easily, because there
           is some symmetry to the scattered light background, but very
           sensitive to positioning errors, especially when working closer to
           the planet, where the brightness gradient is steeper
        4. chopping between concentric apertures of different sizes: known to
           work well for Triton and Deimos, but requires additional
           calibration observations;
