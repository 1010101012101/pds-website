                         WORKSHOP ANNOUNCEMENT

We are pleased to announce a workshop to discuss observing opportunities
during the upcoming passages of the Earth and Sun through Saturn's ring
plane.  The meeting will take place Thursday and Friday, May 26-27, 1994
at the University of Arizona in Tucson.  It is sponsored jointly by the
Planetary Data System Rings Node and the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory
of the University of Arizona.  A preliminary agenda follows at the end
of this message. 

We have reserved a block of rooms at the Plaza Hotel 602-327-7341 at $49
(+tax) per room for May 25-27.  To get this reduced rate, indicate that
you are a participant in the "Saturn Workshop" when you make your
reservation.  Reservations must be made before May 11.  If you have any
further questions about local arrangements, contact Steve Larson
(slarson@comet.lpl.arizona.edu; 602-621-4973). 

We plan to set up an "ftp" site at the PDS Rings Node for further 
information about the workshop and about Saturn observing opportunities.
We will inform you by email when this is available.  If you have
further questions about this facility or about the workshop agenda,
contact Mark Showalter (showalter@ringside.arc.nasa.gov; 415-604-3382). 

Please pass this announcement on to any of your colleagues who might 
also be interested.  We look forward seeing you in Tucson.
