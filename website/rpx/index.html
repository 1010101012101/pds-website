# The 1995-1996 Saturn Ring Plane Crossings

The Sun and Earth passed through Saturn's ring plane in 1995 and 1996,
providing a unique opportunity to observe Saturn's faintest rings and smallest
satellites. The edge- on viewing geometry also permited direct observations of
the main rings' thickness, and the timing of satellite eclipses and mutual
events that can be used to improve ephemerides.

The Rings Node has prepared data sets from several of the observations made
during the RPX observing campaign. These are summarized in the following table
which also provides links to the data.

###  Accessing Saturn RPX Data

  * **Note: Only those volumes showing a status of "Archived" have fully completed the PDS peer review process.**

  * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume. 

  * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundled" link. 

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/targzip.htm).

those observers willing to provide them. For more information please contact
us.
