# Event Predictions

J. E. Arlot and W. Thuillot of the Bureau des Londitudes in Paris have
predicted the times of events (transits, occultations and eclipses) involving
the classical satellites of Saturn. Their paper (_Icarus_ **105**, 427-440,
1993) contains tables of the most easily observed events. The complete lists
are available here and also via anonymous FTP from [ ftp://ftp.bdl.fr/pub/misc
/phesat95_thomas/](ftp://ftp.bdl.fr/pub/misc/phesat95_thomas/).

P. D. Nicholson of Cornell University has predicted the times of eclipse
disappearances and reappearances for the small inner satellites. Eclipse
disappearances occur between May 22 and Aug 10; reappearances occur between
Nov 21 and Feb 11, 1996. There are 100-150 events in each set. The times are
accurate to within a few minutes, subject to larger ephemeris errors for Atlas
and especially for Pan (about 1 hour). All times are corrected for mean light
travel time, and are in UTC. The Janus/Epimetheus ephemeris includes the co-
orbital libration model from Nicholson _et al._ (_Icarus_ **100**, 464-484,
1992); the Pan ephemeris is based on Showalter, [ Visual detection of 1981S13,
Saturn's eighteenth satellite, and its role in the Encke
gap](/reference/abstracts/showalter1991_02.html) (_Nature_ **351**, 709-713,
1991); the other ephemerides are from JPL. All assume circular orbits.
Nicholson has more accurate predictions for individual dates, if needed,
including the eccentricities and inclinations, and instantaneous light time
corrections.

Following the May and August 1995 events, P. D. Nicholson has revised
predictions of eclipse reappearance times for
[Prometheus](prometheus_revised.txt), [Pandora](pandora_revised.txt),
[Janus](janus_revised.txt), and [Epimetheus](epimetheus_revised.txt). Note
that Prometheus event times have changed rather significantly.

Dr. Eliot Young of NASA Ames is organizing a campaign to map the surface of
Titan using satellite mutual events.
