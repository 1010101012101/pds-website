# What is a SPICE file?

The Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility (NAIF) Node of the Planetary
Data System is responsible for the design, implementation and operation of the
SPICE information system--**a means for providing ancillary observation
geometry data and related tools used in the planning and interpretation of
science instrument observations returned from planetary spacecraft.**

The SPICE acronym comes from:  **S** | Spacecraft  
---|---  
**P** | Planet  
**I** | Instrument  
**C** | "C-matrix"  
**E** | Events  
  
SPICE data files, called kernels, exist for spacecraft trajectory (S), planet,
satellite, comet and asteroid ephemerides and associated physical and
cartographic constants (P), instrument information, including mounting
alignment and other relevant geometric information (I), orientation of
spacecraft structures upon which science instruments are mounted (C); and
spacecraft and ground data system events, both planned and unplanned (E).

The <a href="//pds.jpl.nasa.gov/naif.html" target="_blank">PDS NAIF node</a> provides SPICE users a
portable ANSI FORTRAN 77 toolkit that contains readers subroutines for
retrieving data from each of the SPICE kernels, plus a wide assortment of
geometry, math, and utility modules useful in computing instrument observation
geometry parameters: examples are range, optic axis intercept latitude and
longitude, and phase, incidence, and emission angles. The NAIF toolkit also
includes utility and demonstration programs, and is accompanied by extensive
user-focused documentation.

The NAIF node is responsible for archiving and distributing SPICE kernel files
produced by NASA's planetary flight projects. NAIF also assembles and
distributes generic planet, satellite, comet, and asteroid ephemeris files, in
SPICE format, used for a wide assortment of mission evaluation, observation
planning and data analysis tasks. These generic ephemeris files are based on
products provided by JPL's Solar System Dynamics Group. (NAIF does not
generally produce or distribute SPICE files for active flight projects; the
project has this responsibility.)

While NASA's planetary missions were the original focus of SPICE development,
today the system is being used, or considered for use, on flight projects in
other disciplines (astrophysics, space physics and Earth science) and in other
countries.

NAIF's products are available to scientists participating in the activities of
NASA's Office of Space Science (Code S). Support for other scientists is
offered to the extent permitted by NASA and Caltech/JPL policies and limited
NAIF resources.

Potential users are advised that programming and science/math skills at an
advanced college level are needed to utilize SPICE products. Users must have a
computer with 25-50 Mbytes of disk space, 8 Mbytes of available RAM and a
FORTRAN compiler. (Resource requirements vary from platform to platform and on
the user's application.) The user's own code must be capable of calling
FORTRAN modules. Internet ftp capability is needed to obtain the necessary
SPICE components.
