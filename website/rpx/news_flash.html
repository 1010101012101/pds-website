## SATELLITES OF SATURN

A. S. Bosh, Lowell Observatory; and A. S. Rivkin, Lowell Observatory and Lunar
and Planetary Laboratory, report: **"We have discovered four probable
satellites of Saturn**, from twenty-seven 400-s images taken in the 890-nm
methane band with the HST Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 during an 11-hr span
at the May 22 [ring-plane crossing](/rpx/rpx.html). For each satellite, we
give below the orbital radius; the angular distance from Saturn at May
22.48584 UT (negative values indicating that the satellite is west of Saturn);
the longitude at the same epoch (measured from the sub-earth point); the
approximate V magnitude at opposition; and the number of images in which the
satellite was detected: S/1995 S 1, 137450 +/- 200 km, -16".4, +120 deg, 17.2,
15; S/1995 S 2, 139700 +/- 300 km, -18".0, +69 deg, 16.3, 12; S/1995 S 3,
141050 +/- 100 km, -10".5, +33 deg, 17.5, 14; S/1995 S 4, 146450 +/- 450 km,
+14".2, -44 deg, 18.3, 11. S/1995 S 1, S 2, and S 3 were identified in each
frame in which they were not close to Saturn or a bright satellite. S/1995 S 4
was not identified in seven frames in which it should have been visible, all
before [ring-plane crossing](/rpx/rpx.html), when the background noise was
higher. Satellite positions were fitted to a circular orbit in the plane of
the rings, including terms arising from Saturn's nonspherical gravity field.
Maximum residuals were in all cases < 0".5, and for S/1995 S 2 and S 3 were no
greater than 0".15, which is approximately the centering error. All known
satellites are accounted for except Saturn XVIII (Pan), XV (Atlas), and XVI
(Prometheus), which may be visible but are still uncertain; the possibility
exists that S/1995 S 1 is Atlas and that S/1995 S 2 is Prometheus, although
they would be 26 and 21 deg from their respective predicted positions. We see
no satellites outside the rings (the distance of which from Saturn at the
times of observation was > 20") with opposition V mag equal to or brighter
than 19, i.e., that of Saturn XIV (Calypso)."
