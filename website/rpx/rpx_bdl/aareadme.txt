AAREADME.TXT -- Updated 15-nov-1994 by Mark Showalter

This directory contains the complete set of satellite event prediction times
generated by J.-E. Arlot and W. Thuillot (Icarus 105, 427-440, 1993) at the
Bureau des Londitudes in Paris.  This is a duplicate of the anonymous FTP
directory "pub/misc/phesat95" on node "ftp.bdl.fr".  We will attempt to keep
this directory up to date, but on occasion the Bureau des Longitudes FTP site
may contain more recent information.

Each table of predicted events in this directory appears in two formats.  The
files "*.dat" are ASCII files and should be transferred using text protocols.
The files "*.dat-gz" are compressed versions of the same files, processed using
the GNU Zip utility.  They should be transferred using binary protocol and then
expanded using GNU Unzip.

This directory contains the following files:

README.                 The documentation file found in the BDL FTP directory.
