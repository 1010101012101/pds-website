# The 1995-1996  
Saturn Observing Campaign

The Sun and Earth passed through Saturn's ring plane in 1995 and 1996,
providing a unique opportunity to observe Saturn's faintest rings and smallest
satellites. The edge-on viewing geometry also permited direct observations of
the main rings' thickness, and the timing of satellite eclipses and mutual
events that can be used to improve ephemerides.

**Note:** This page contains planning tools and information used primarily in preparation for the events in 1995 and 1996. More up-to-date [observing tools](/tools/tools.html) are now available elsewhere.

## Ephemerides

The 1995-6 ephemeris distribution service has been disabled. Contact the [PDS
Navigation and Ancillary Information Node](http://pds-naif.jpl.nasa.gov/). for
data and software.

## Event Predictions

](predicts.html) J. E. Arlot and W. Thuillot of the Bureau des Londitudes in
Paris predicted the times of events (transits, occultations and eclipses)
involving the classical satellites of Saturn.

P. D. Nicholson of Cornell University predicted the times of eclipse
disappearances and reappearances for the small inner satellites. Following the
May and August 1995 events, P. D. Nicholson revised the predictions of eclipse
reappearance times for Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, and Epimetheus. The
Prometheus event times changed rather significantly.

## [Saturn Viewer

](/tools/viewer2_sat.html) This utility enables you to render a diagram
showing the appearance of Saturn, its moons and rings at any time during 1995
and 1996. Diagrams are rendered in Postscript format. Here are a few
[examples](viewer/examples/examples.html). Newer [observing
tools](/tools/tools.html) are now recommended.

[

## Saturn Moon Tracker

](/tools/tracker2_sat.html) This utility enables you to generate diagrams
showing the motion of Saturn's moons during 1995 and 1996. Diagrams are
rendered in Postscript format. Newer [observing tools](/tools/tools.html) are
now recommended.

[

## Tucson Workshop Proceedings

](workshop.html) A preparatory workshop for the Saturn ring plane crossing was
held in Tucson, May 26 and 27, 1994. The proceedings contain the viewgraphs
from every presentation.
