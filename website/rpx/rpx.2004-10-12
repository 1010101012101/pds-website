<h1>The 1995-1996<br> Saturn Ring Plane Crossings</h1>
</center>
<p>
The Sun and Earth passed through Saturn's ring plane in 1995 and 1996,
providing a unique opportunity to observe Saturn's faintest rings and 
smallest satellites.  The edge-on viewing geometry also permited direct
observations of the main rings' thickness, and the timing of satellite eclipses
and mutual events that can be used to improve ephemerides.

<h2>Data Sets</h2>
<ul>

<li>
<h3>Hubble Space Telescope</b></h3>

All Saturn data from the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995 is now in the public
domain.
The Rings Node has prepared a set of five CDROMs containing archives of
all Saturn images obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Wide
Field/Planetary Camera 2 during 1994 and 1995.  Preview copies of the
the volumes
<a href="/cds/RPX_0001">RPX_0001</a>,
<a href="/cds/RPX_0002">RPX_0002</a>,
<a href="/cds/RPX_0003">RPX_0003</a>,
<a href="/cds/RPX_0004">RPX_0004</a> and
<a href="/cds/RPX_0005">RPX_0005</a>
are
available on line.  To order the disks, send a request to 
<a href="/showalter.html">Dr. Mark Showalter</a>
or 
<a href="/~neilheat">Neil Heather</a>.
Consult
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/">Space Telescope Science Institute</a>
for more information about the Hubble Space Telescope.
<p>
These and other HST images can also be selected from the on-line

<h3>Ground-based Data</h3>

Data from the William Herschel Telescope has been archived as volume
<a href="/cds/RPX_0101/">RPX_0101</a>.

<p>
The Rings Node is also archiving other ring plane
crossing data sets from those observers willing to provide them.  For more
information please contact us.
