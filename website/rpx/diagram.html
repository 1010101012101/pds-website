# Saturnicentric latitude  
of the Earth and Sun

![\[RPX DIAGRAM\]](diagram.gif)  
This diagram shows the apparent Saturn-centered latitude of the Sun and Earth
during the ring plane crossing periods. Times of crossing events (as observed
at Earth) and opposition are indicated. The shaded regions correspond to the
times when the unlit side of the rings will be visible from Earth.

Note that the Sun is shown by a double-line, indicating the size of the solar
disk as seen from Saturn. Because of its size, it takes roughly four days for
the solar disk to cross the ring plane.

A [ previous version](/rpx/proceedings/saturnicentric.gif) of this diagram has
been found to be slightly inaccurate.
