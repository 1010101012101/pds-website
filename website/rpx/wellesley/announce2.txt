    ****************************************************************

You are cordially invited to attend a workshop on the 1995/6 Saturn ring
plane crossings.  The meeting will be held at the Whitin Observatory at
Wellesley College on July 25-26, just before the 1997 DPS Meeting. 

TOPICS TO BE COVERED

Data Set Overviews: circumstances, goals, instruments, properties.
Main Rings:         thickness, asymmetries, pole precession, atmosphere.
F Ring:             structure, clump/moon interpretations.
E and G Rings:      structure, photometry, dynamical models.
Small moons:        astrometry, photometry, orbits, Prometheus models.

ABSTRACT SUBMISSIONS

Abstract deadline:  June 4 (same as the DPS abstract deadline)
Submit to:          abstracts@ringside.arc.nasa.gov

We will accept abstracts in a variety of formats: Using the DPS abstract
template, plain TeX, LaTeX, Postscript, Microsoft Word RTF, or plain
ASCII text. The first line of the abstract should contain the title. The
second line should contain a list of authors and their affiliations. The
body of the text should follow. Each abstract must fit on a single
8.5x11 inch sheet of paper. 

The workshop will be structured around a series of ~30 minute
contributed presentations, with plenty of discussion time interspersed.
There will be no "speaker's rule," so participants may submit more than
one abstract if they wish. We encourage presentations describing data
sets not yet fully analyzed, as well as presentations of more definitive
results. Contributors are free to submit abstracts on the same material
to the DPS meeting. 

A meeting schedule and abstracts will appear on the web page in late 
June. No proceedings of the workshop will be published.

HOUSING

Ten double rooms have been reserved at the Wellesley College Club
(617-283-2700) for the nights of July 24 and July 25. The cost is
$65/single, $80/double. The deadline for reserving a room is July 6. The
Wellesley College Club is located on campus. 

Housing will also be available on the MIT campus for three days prior to 
the DPS Meeting.  See the DPS Web page (http://web.mit.edu/dps97/) for 
more information.

TRANSPORTATION

Wellesley is located about 13 miles west of Boston. Regularly scheduled
commuter rail service runs between Boston and Wellesley, and the
Wellesley station is about half a mile from the College Club. The
College Club is within walking distance of the observatory and also the
town of Wellesley, where you can find restaurants and other amenities. 

The MBTA subway runs from Cambridge to Woodland on the Green Line, but
the Woodland stop is several miles from the campus, which makes this
less convenient. 

If you wish to drive to Wellesley, consult the web page for directions.
