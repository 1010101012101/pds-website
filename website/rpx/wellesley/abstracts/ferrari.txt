Ground-based observations of the August 1995 Saturn's ring plane crossing
with the University of Hawaii Adaptive Optics System have led to the discovery
of several new objects orbiting around the planet. Their orbits are known
with variable accuracy but most of them are compatible with the F ring. Some
of these objects are clearly azimuthally elongated structures, possible arcs, 
the others are not resolved. Planetary arcs are swarms of clumps, which largest
particles are most probaly unresolved kilometer-sized objects (Ferrari and 
Brahic, 1992, 1994, 1997). Are these objects evolving with time ? On which 
timescale ? The F ring arcs have been first observed during the Voyager 
encounters. New constraints on the evolution of the brightests of them, on a 
two-weeks timescale, at the epoch of the Voyager 2 encounter, are presented.
A revised orbit of the F ring is used to derive an azimuthal distribution of the 
newly discovered objects at August 1995 epoch. This is compared with the 
azimuthal profile of the F ring observed three months later during the Sun ring 
plane crossing (Nicholson et al., 1996). The possible nature and lifetime of 
these new objects is discussed.
