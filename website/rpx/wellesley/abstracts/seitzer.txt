Satellite Detection Limits in HST Data

We analyze the completeness of detecting satellites in the 1995/1996
Saturn WFPC2 data sets.  Artificial satellites of known magnitude and
angular motion are introduced into pairs of WFPC2 images, and the
frequency of recovery is determined as a function of angular motion,
total magnitude, and whether the satellite is projected on or off the
rings.  This recovery frequency is then used to place limits on the
sizes and distance from Saturn of undiscovered satellites.
