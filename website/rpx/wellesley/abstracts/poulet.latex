% DPSFORM.TEX -- DPS meeting abstract electronic form.

% DON'T remove the following comment; it identifies the form.
%
% Division of Planetary Sciences electronic abstract form.

% COMMENTS are preceded by the "%" character.  Lines (or portions of
% lines) that start with a "%" are ignored by LaTeX.  Such lines may be
% left in the file during processing.
%
% Lines that are to be filled in by the author start at the left margin
% with either "\" or "%\".  Indented lines that start with "% " are
% examples only, and should be left alone.

% The following two lines are REQUIRED.  Leave them alone.

%  The following line ("\input epsf") is REQUIRED if you are including
%  an encapsulated PostScript file in your abstract, so you must
%  remove the percent sign. If you aren't including a figure, you
%  can leave the line commented out (i.e., leave the percent sign).
%  If you are including a figure, you will need to e-mail it
%  to dps97@cass.jsc.nasa.gov BEFORE you e-mail your abstract. The
%  subject line of your e-mail message must be "DPS EPS FILE: XXXXXX.eps",
%  where "XXXXXX.eps" matches EXACTLY the file name you inserted in the body
%  of your abstract. Try to use a unique file name (e.g., "mjb547" instead
%  of "Fig1"), because the system will automatically reject any eps file
%  having a file name that is an exact duplicate of a file name already
%  used by another author.

% Authors and their affiliations are specified in groups by
% institution.  Each group of authors from the same institution whose
% names appear next to each other in the author list should be given
% together in a single \author statement, their names separated by
% commas.  The institution should be specified in an \affil statement
% that follows; please abbreviate institution names as much as possible.
% When several institutions are involved, additional \author and \affil
% pairs are required. The only punctuation the author needs to provide
% is a comma to separate two (or more) authors' names from the same
% affiliation. DO NOT use a comma before Sr., Jr., III, etc.
%
% For example, an author list that looks like this:
%
%    P. B. Boyce, H. Dalterio (AAS), C. D. Biemesderfer (NOAO),
%    R. J. Hanisch (STScI), J. Johnson (AAS)
%
% would be specified like this:

%    \author{P. B. Boyce, H. Dalterio}
%    \affil{AAS}
%    \author{C. D. Biemesderfer}
%    \affil{NOAO}

\begin{abstract}

We will examine the role played by the Saturn F ring during the plane crossings 
in 1995-96. Emphasis is given on the ring thickness and the small inner 
objects.

We model the photometric data obtained during the Earth ring plane crossings 
and the solar crossing. The data from the Earth ring plane crossing 
could give lower limit on the physical height of the F ring (Poulet 
and Sicardy, {\em BAAS} {\bf 28}, 1124). New constraints from the solar 
crossing in November 1995 are obtained, in order to explain both the August 
and November 1995 profiles. 

New detections of four small inner objects were made, allowing us to 
cover several revolutions of two objects. We use the photometric model 
to infer the nature of these new objects. We also propose that they are 
composed of regolith ejecta and result from collisions between small 
moonlets. From the number and optical depth, we derive the lifetimes of 
the new objects and we estimate the total cross-sectionnal area and sizes 
of the unseen parent objects to be consistent with observations 
of the F ring region.
