Abstract: A photometric analysis of the August 1995 HST data is presented.
A model developed from adaptive optics observations is compared with the
photometric profiles observed along the rings. The model is found to be in
good agreement with the data apart from the East-West asymmetry.

For the asymmetry, two possible effects are discussed. One is the
occultation of the main rings by an inclined F ring. The other is a large
scale distortion of the ring surface. An analytic model for a plausible
distortion is fitted to the data. The implications of the result are
discussed.
