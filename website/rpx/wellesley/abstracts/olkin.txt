Inclined Features in Saturn's Rings

On 21 November 1995 just as the Sun was completing its passage through Saturn's 
ring plane, the occultation of the star GSC5249-01240 by Saturn and its rings was 
observed with the Faint Object Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and 
from the Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). The low opening angle of Saturn’s rings (B ~ 
3°) made these occultation observations unusually sensitive to ring inclinations.  We used 
these data along with previous occultation data to determine a kinematic model for the F 
ring and established a non-zero value for the inclination of the F ring with a 4-s 
significance level.  This is the first detection of an inclined ring feature in the Saturn 
system.  The inclined ring model predicts an eclipse of the F ring near the West ansa.  HST 
images taken immediately after the stellar occultation show an abrupt decline in flux very 
near the predicted location, providing support for the inclined ring model.  This model also 
predicts an eclipse of the F ring on the East ansa closer to Saturn.  We will examine images 
for evidence of any dimming on the East ansa.  We will also present results of a search for 
other inclined features in Saturn's rings.
