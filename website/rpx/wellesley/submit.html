#  Abstract Submission Guidelines

Abstract deadline: **June 4** (same as the DPS abstract deadline)  
Submit to: [
abstracts@ringside.arc.nasa.gov](mailto://abstracts@ringside.arc.nasa.gov)

We will accept abstracts in a variety of formats: Using the DPS abstract
template, plain TeX, LaTeX, Postscript, Microsoft Word RTF, or plain ASCII
text. The first line of the abstract should contain the title. The second line
should contain a list of authors and their affiliations. The body of the text
should follow. Each abstract must fit on a single 8.5x11 inch sheet of paper.

There will be no "speaker's rule," so participants may submit more than one
abstract if they wish. We encourage presentations describing data sets not yet
fully analyzed, as well as presentations of more definitive results.
Contributors are free to submit abstracts on the same material to the DPS
meeting.

## Representative Topics

  * **F Ring:** structure, clump/moon interpretations
