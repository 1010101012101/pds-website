###  RSS Radio Occultation Profiles

  * The PDS Rings node has posted a dataset of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from RSS radio occultation data obtained 
    during the prime mission. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 30 high quality 
    RSS occultations. 

  * You may browse the dataset [CORSS_8001](/viewmaster/volumes/CORSS_8xxx), or download the entire dataset 
    [CORSS_8001 tar.gz](/viewmaster/archives-volumes/CORSS_8xxx/). 
    
  * Version 2 of this dataset, which includes the addition of highest practical resolution, pre-diffraction corrected 
    data, and expands the dataset coverage to the entire mission, is <strong>available by request and will be posted online in 
    early 2019. In the mean time, you may request the data using the Questions/Feedback button to the left</strong>.


NOTE: Raw RSS data may be obtained from the [PDS Atmospheres Node](//pds-
atmospheres.nmsu.edu/).
