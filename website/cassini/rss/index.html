###  Update May 2014: RSS Radio Occultation Profiles

  * The PDS Rings node has posted a dataset of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from RSS radio occultation data. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 30 high quality RSS occultations. The dataset has completed peer review and is now in lien resolution. Although there are a few liens against the dataset, it has been PDS certified and is eligible for use under some [ROSES 2014](/roses/) programs. 

  * Users may browse the dataset [CORSS_8001](/vol/CORSS_8xxx_lien_resolution/CORSS_8001/), or download the entire dataset [CORSS_8001 tar.gz](/archives/CORSS_8xxx_lien_resolution/CORSS_8001.tar.gz). 


NOTE: Raw RSS data may be obtained from the [PDS Atmospheres Node](http://pds-
atmospheres.nmsu.edu/).
