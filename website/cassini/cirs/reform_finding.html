## Finding the Data You Want

![\[SPACER\]](/css/spacer.gif)

###  1\. Search Options

![\[SPACER\]](/css/spacer.gif)

  * **Use our [multi-mission search engine](//tools.pds-rings.seti.org/opus) to search for specific Cassini CIRS data products using a wide range of criteria.**

    * Search results include data files, tables of associated metadata, and footprint diagrams for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as tar.gz files for easy downloading. 

  * The [Access Re-formatted Data](access_reform.html) tab, provides a link to each volume and gives the time interval covered by the volume. 

  * As you develop your personal search strategies, you may wish to refer to the [TUTORIAL.TXT](TUTORIAL.TXT) file which contains the definitive documentation on the contents and structure of the re-formatted CIRS data.

###  2\. Using Indices

![\[SPACER\]](/css/spacer.gif)

Volume specific index files are located in the INDEX subdirectory on each
volume. You can use the index files to refine a search within the volume.
Index files have PDS labels, and those labels refer to .FMT files in the same
directory that describe the column structure in each index.

  * The master index file INDEX/INDEX.TAB contains the general information about every data file on the volume (one data file per line). One keyword reported in the INDEX.TAB files is OBSERVATION_ID which contains the unique CIMS request ID associated with a given file. For information about how to interpret the CIMS ID, see section [3\. Introduction to the Cassini Timeline](reform_about.html#cims) under the About Re-formtted Data tab.

  * Supplemental index files INDEX/RININDEX.TAB, INDEX/POIINDEX.TAB and INDEX/ISPMINDEX.TAB contain tables of these additional parameters. They can be used for identifying, for example, which observation captured a particular latitude, longitude and incidence angle on the surface of Enceladus. 

  * More detailed searches can be conducted by reading the metadata files row by row, which will enable you to identify the specific detectors that captured a target under the desired circumstances.

###  3\. Directory and File Names

  * Another option is to use the VOLUME_ID, coupled with subdirectory and file names and browse the data directories. See the [Naming Conventions: Re-formtted Data](reform_dir_names.html) tab for insights into the naming structures for the re-formatted data set.
