### Significant Updates

  * **As of April 2010, Version 2 of the original format CIRS data is now the basis for all of the re-formatted volumes**. 
  
  * **Beginning in July 2011, the team revised the data file contents multiple times (see below). The data files serve as input files for our pipeline. The changes broke the pipeline**.
  
  * **Consequently we will not revise the pipeline until the final CIRS delivery has been made to PDS**. 

      * When the reformatting pipeline update is complete, we will reformat the entire final version dataset, and all of the volumes will be available via the table below. 

  * **In January 2011**, the entire reformatted data set was regenerated again in order to clean up minor errors mostly relating to documentation. No significant changes were made to the data files which had been generated in or subsequent to the the major revision in April 2010. The January 2011 version is considered stable pending a follow-up review by the original peer review panel. 

  * **In July 2011, the CIRS team again redelivered their entire data set, this time as version 3.1** 
  
    * Significant changes were made to their data files which serve as input files for our pipeline. 
    
  * **In January 2015, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher); this time as version 3.2**. 

    * The version 3.2 release incorporates further refinements in the calibration algorithm and corrects some errors in that pipeline. 

    * The version 3.2 release also includes new, highly derived products in the /DATA/CUBE directory tree of each volume. 

  * **In early May 2016, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher)**.
   
    * The primary data set, CO-S-CIRS-2/3/4-TSDR-V3.2 remains unchanged.  
    
    * The data set of highly derived products, CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V1.0, contains numerous corrections over the original delivery. 

  * **In April 2018, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher)**. 

    * The primary data set, CO-S-CIRS-2/3/4-TSDR-V4.0, and the data set of highly derived products, CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V2.0, reflect changes to several calibration routines.

    * For a complete list of changes in versions 2, 3 and 4, see the end of the <a href="orig_DATASET.TXT" target="_blank">DATASET.CAT</a> file. Identical copies of this file are in the CATALOG directory of each volume.

    * For more details about the reformatted CIRS data, see [About Re-formatted Data](reform_about.html) and the links on that page. 

    * For more details about the CIRS data, including more information regarding the changes reflected in versions 2 and 3 of the data, see [About CIRS Data](about.html) and the links on that page. 

    * Please [notify us](/cgi-bin/comments/form.pl) of any problems or concerns you have with this version of the re-formatted CIRS data. 

### Getting the Data You Want

  * Use **[OPUS](/search)**, our versatile search engine to find and retrieve specific Cassini CIRS data products using a wide range of criteria. However, OPUS currently only supports CIRS data submitted prior to July 2011.

      * Search results include data files, tables of associated meta data, and footprint diagrams for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) files for easy downloading. 

    * The table below contains links to all of the available data volumes from the Saturn encounter re-formatted into fixed length data files. For information on the re-formatted data, see [About Re-formatted Data.](reform_about.html)

      * **Review** the Volume on-line by clicking the volume number. 

      * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column. 

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.

Be aware that even with a 4:1 compression ratio, the Bundled versions can be
on the order of 4GB and may take a few hours to download. Users are encouraged
to download during the late night/early morning hours California time.

  * **Footprint** will take you to a directory containing footprint diagrams of each CIRS observation in the volume. 

The footprint diagrams contain a wealth of information. The key for these diagrams is given in <a href="COCIRS_previews.txt" target="_blank">COCIRS_previews.txt</a>.

### Available Volumes

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.

  * **All reformtted volumes are based on version 2 of the original format data.**
