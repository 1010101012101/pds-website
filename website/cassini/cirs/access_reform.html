### Significant Updates

  * **As of April 2010, Version 2 of the original format CIRS data is now the basis for all of the re-formatted volumes**. For information about the version changes, see [ About Cirs Data.](about.html#versions)
We believe this newer version is much improved over earlier versions and
strongly encourage users to replace the earlier versions for future research.

    * In addition during the April 2010 revision, the contents and organization of the reformatted volumes were significantly changed based in part on recommendations of the peer review panel. All of the liens identified by the panel were addressed is this revision. 

  * **In January 2011**, the entire reformatted data set was regenerated again in order to clean up minor errors mostly relating to documentation. No significant changes were made to the data files which had been generated in or subsequent to the the major revision in April 2010. The January 2011 version is considered stable pending a follow-up review by the original peer review panel. 

  * **In July 2011, the CIRS team again redelivered their entire data set, this time as version 3.1** Significant changes were made to their data files which serve as input files for our pipeline. Until we complete the necessary modifications to our pipeline software, we are unable to generate reformatted versions of the data based on version 3.1. 

  * **In January 2015, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher); this time as version 3.2. On line, we replaced version 3.1 of the CIRS data set with version 3.2**. 

    * The version 3.2 release incorporates further refinements in the calibration algorithm and corrects some errors in that pipeline, and again alters the organization of the data files; further complicating the update to our pipeline. Until we complete the necessary modifications to our pipeline software, we are unable to generate reformatted versions of the data based on version 3.n. 

    * **Consequently, the reformatted volumes remain based on version 2 of the data, and new volumes, beginning with COCIRS_1007, currently are available only in the original format.**

      * When the reformatting pipeline update is complete, we will reformat the entire version 3 data set, and all of the volumes will be available via the table below. 

    * For more details about the reformatted CIRS data, see [About Re-formatted Data](reform_about.html) and the links on that page. 

    * For more details about the CIRS data, including more information regarding the changes reflected in versions 2 and 3 of the data, see [About CIRS Data](about.html) and the links on that page. 

    * Please [ notify us](/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?) of any problems or concerns you have with this version of the re- formatted CIRS data. 

### Getting the Data You Want

  * Use **[OPUS](/search)**, our versatile search engine to find and retrieve specific Cassini CIRS data products using a wide range of criteria. However, OPUS currently only supports CIRS data submitted prior to July 2011.

      * Search results include data files, tables of associated meta data, and footprint diagrams for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as tar.gz files for easy downloading. 

    * The table below contains links to all of the available data volumes from the Saturn encounter re-formatted into fixed length data files. For information on the re-formatted data, see [About Re-formatted Data.](reform_about.html)

      * **Review** the Volume on-line by clicking the volume number. 

      * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column. 

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/help/targz.html).

Be aware that even with a 4:1 compression ratio, the Bundled versions can be
on the order of 4GB and may take a few hours to download. Users are encouraged
to download during the late night/early morning hours California time.

  * **Footprint** will take you to a directory containing footprint diagrams of each CIRS observation in the volume. 

The footprint diagrams contain a wealth of information. The key for these diagrams is given in [COCIRS_previews.txt](COCIRS_previews.txt).

### Available Volumes

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.

  * **All reformtted volumes are based on version 2 of the original format data.**
