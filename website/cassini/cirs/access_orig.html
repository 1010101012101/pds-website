### Significant Updates

  * **In January 2010, the CIRS team redelivered their entire data set as version 2. On line, we replaced version 1 of the CIRS data set, with version 2.**.

    * In every regard, the new data files appear to be more reliable and better calibrated than the version 1 data.

  * **In July 2011, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher); this time as version 3.1. On line, we replaced version 2 of the CIRS data set with version 3.1**. 

    * The version 3.1 release incorporates a further refinement in the calibration algorithm and a revision the contents of the data files.

  * For a complete list of changes in versions 2 & 3, see the end of the [DATASET.CAT](orig_DATASET.TXT) file. Identical copies of this file are in the CATALOG directory of each volume.

  * For more details about the CIRS data, including more information regarding the changes reflected in versions 2 and 3 of the data, see [About CIRS Data](about.html) and the links on that page.

  * Users who obtained CIRS data prior to July 2011 are strongly encouraged to replace their holdings with the version 3 data.

  * **In January 2015, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher); this time as version 3.2. On line, we replaced version 3.1 of the CIRS data set with version 3.2**. 

    * The version 3.2 release incorporates further refinements in the calibration algorithm and corrects some errors in that pipeline. 

    * The version 3.2 release also includes new, highly derived products in the /DATA/CUBE directory tree of each volume. These files are part of a new, additional data set, CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V1.0. **This portion of each volume has not completed peer review and is not PDS certified. **

  * **In early May 2016, the CIRS team again redelivered the Saturn encounter data (volumes COCIRS_0401 and higher). The primary data set, CO-S-CIRS-2/3/4-TSDR-V3.2 remains unchanged.  The data set of highly derived products, CO-S-CIRS-5-CUBES-V1.0, contains numerous corrections over the original delivery. On May 10, 2016 this data set, including all deliveries as of that date, was PDS certified**. 

  * For a complete list of changes in versions 2 & 3, see the end of the [DATASET.CAT](orig_DATASET.TXT) file. Identical copies of this file are in the CATALOG directory of each volume.

  * For more details about the CIRS data, including more information regarding the changes reflected in the various versions of the data, see [About CIRS Data](about.html) and the links on that page.

  * Users who wish access to previous versions of the original format data should [ contact us](/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?) or the [ PDS Atmospheres Node](http://pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/contact_us/contact_us.htm) directly. 

### Getting the Data You Want

  * Use **[OPUS**](http://tools.pds-rings.seti.org/opus), our versatile search engine to find and retrieve specific Cassini CIRS data products using a wide range of criteria. However, OPUS currently only supports CIRS data submitted prior to July 2011.**

    * Search results include data files, tables of associated meta data, and footprint diagrams for each observation. User selected data files can be bundled as tar.gz files for easy downloading. 

    * **Note: The results returned by OPUS are the reformatted versions of CIRS.** However, users can use the returned tables of meta data to identify the corresponding original format data. 

  * The table below contains links to all of the available data volumes from cruise, Jupiter, and Saturn. 

    * Clicking on the VOLUME_ID will allow you to browse the volume. 

    * Clicking on TSDR_INDEX.TAB opens the index of Time Sequential Data Records products contained in the volume. This is an index of the calibrated files, but does not include entries for the highly derived CUBE products also included in the volumes beginning with the version 3.2 redelivery. 

    * To download an entire volume, right click on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second column. 

The bundled volumes are provided in tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/documents/targz.html).

Be aware that even with a 4:1 compression ratio, the bundled versions can be
on the order of 4GB and may take a few hours to download. Users are encouraged
to download during the late night/early morning hours California time.

    * We have developed footprint diagrams for each CIRS Observation obtained during the Saturn encounter phase. These are associated with the reformatted versions of the CIRS holdings and can be accessed from the table on the [Access Re-formatted Data](access_reform.html) tab. 

### Available Volumes

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.
