### New

  * The second table below now includes links to preview images for all UVIS cubes. 

Since UVIS observations contain a lot of imformation which is target
dependent, representing that information with reasonable fidelity is complex.
Consequently we have provided a [key for the UVIS
previews.](UVIS_previews.txt).

  * In addition to the raw data referenced below, the PDS Rings node has a new, data set of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from UVIS stellar occultation data. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 50 UVIS stellar occultations. The data set is still being compiled and has not undergone lien resolution. 

** Since the data has not undergone lien resolution, users should exercise caution when using the data.**

Users may browse the lien resolution data set
[COUVIS_8001](/webapps/link/volumes/COUVIS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COUVIS_8001/), or download the
entire data set [COUVIS_8001
tar.gz](/webapps/link/archives-volumes/COUVIS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COUVIS_8001.tar.gz).

Please [ contact us](/cgi-bin/comment-form.pl?) if you encounter difficulties
with the data, identify errors in the data set, or have suggestions for
improvement of the data set.

### Getting the Data You Want

  * The tables below contain links to all of the available raw UVIS data, including all four 'phases': calibration, cruise, Jupiter, and Saturn data. This data is also available through the [ PDS Atmospheres Node](//pds-atmospheres.nmsu.edu/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/UVIS.html). 

  * For each phase, individual observations are grouped by observation type into one of five virtual "data sets" (cruise and Jupiter calibration data are combined in a single data set). Here are the data product types associated with each data set identifier: 
    * -calib-  Calibration data.
    * -cube-  Spatial spectral image cubes.
    * -spec-  Edited spectra.
    *  -ssb-   Solar and stellar occulation data.
    *  -wav-   Images taken at a single wavelength.

  * However, the data are physically organized into chronological "volumes" that are mission phase and data set independent. Consequently, any given volume will contain data products from several data sets and in some instances from multiple mission phases. 

  * For more information about the organization and naming conventions used in the UVIS archive, see [About UVIS Data](about.html). 

  * The following tables provide links to individual **volumes**. 
    * The first table identifies which volumes which contain data products for each of the data set types.

    * The second table is arranged by volume and includes temporal coverage information and links to various options including directories of preview images.

    * **Review** a volume on-line by clicking the volume ID in either table. 

    * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second table. 

The bundled volumes are provided in .tar.gz format. For information on opening
files of this type, click [here](/help/targz.html).

    * **PREVIEW** will take you to a directory containing sub-directories of preview images for each UVIS cube in the volume. 

The preview images contain a wealth of information. The key for the preview
images is in [UVIS_previews.txt](UVIS_previews.txt).

### Available Data sets and the volumes which contain them

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages


{% assign table_name = "Cassini UVIS Data Sets" %}
{% assign table_desc = "A listing of Cassini UVIS Data Sets" %}
{% assign table_data = site.data.tables['cassini_uvis_datasets'] %}
{% include data_table.html %}





### Temporal coverage of each volume

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.


 
{% assign table_name = "Cassini UVIS Releases" %}
{% assign table_desc = "A listing of Cassini UVIS Releases" %}
