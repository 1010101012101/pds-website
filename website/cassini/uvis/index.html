## Overview

The Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) has two spectrographic
channels that provide images and spectra covering the ranges from 56 to 118 nm
and 110 to 190 nm. A third optical path with a solar blind CsI photocathode is
used for a high signal-to- noise ratio, stellar occultation by rings and
atmospheres. A separate hydrogen deuterium absorption cell measures the
relative abundance of deuterium and hydrogen from their lyman-alpha emission.

###  UVIS Occultation Profiles Updated May 2014

The PDS Rings node has a dataset of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from
UVIS stellar occultation data. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and
10 km resolution from more than 50 UVIS stellar occultations. The dataset has
completed peer review and is now in lien resolution. Although there are a few
liens against the data set it has been PDS certified and is eligible for use
under some [ROSES 2014](/roses/) programs.

**A few liens are specific to the data as opposed to the documentation. These are described in the [ERRATA.TXT](/volumes/COUVIS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COUVIS_8001/ERRATA.TXT) file located in the root directory of the data set.**

Users may browse the data set
[COUVIS_8001](/vol/COUVIS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COUVIS_8001/), or download the
entire data set [COUVIS_8001
tar.gz](/archives/COUVIS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COUVIS_8001.tar.gz).
