# 3 Archive Volume Generation

## 3.1 Data Transfer and Validation Methods

The Cassini RPWS Standard Product Archive Collection is produced by the
Cassini RPWS investigation team centered at The University of Iowa with other
sites including Goddard Space Flight Center; the University of Minnesota; the
Observatoire de Paris in Meudon, France; CETP in Velizy, France; University of
Sheffield, Sheffield, UK; Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Uppsala, Sweden;
the Academy of Sciences in Sweden; and University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. The
archiving activity is carried out in cooperation with the PDS Planetary Plasma
Interactions (PPI) Node at the University of California, Los Angeles and the
Outer Planets subnode of the PPI at The University of Iowa. The Cassini
archiving is funded by the Cassini project through a contract between The
University of Iowa and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The PPI activities are
funded by the Planetary Data System.

The Archive Collection will include data acquired during the Cassini cruise to
Saturn, including the two Venus flybys, the Earth and Jupiter flybys, and
interplanetary cruise as well as data acquired during the prime mission in
Saturn orbit. The archive validation procedure described in this section
applies to volumes generated during all phases of the mission. At least the
first two or possibly three data volumes will be validated in detail via the
PDS peer review procedure, but it is anticipated that once any issues raised
by that peer review are resolved, subsequent volumes will be validated as to
format and content by the PPI node and for scientific integrity and
completeness through the use of the data by the RPWS science team and others.

A single archive volume set of Cassini RPWS data is produced for the entire
Cassini mission. When sufficient data for a new archive volume are ready for
validation, the RPWS team will deliver a DVD-R volume with the data to the PPI
Node of the PDS. The volume will include PDS documentation (label) files and
ancillary products (index tables, HTML access files, etc.). Each volume of
standard products, documentation, and ancillary products is stored on a
recordable digital versatile disk (DVD-R) generated by the RPWS team. All data
formats are based on the Planetary Data System standards as documented in the
PDS Standards Reference [section 2.3-6, Applicable Documents].

The RPWS Team will produce three copies of each DVD-R. One will be sent to the
PPI node at UCLA, one to the PDS Central Node at JPL, and the third copy will
be kept at The University of Iowa. These three copies are used for validation
at The University of Iowa, PPI, and the Central Node. Upon successful
validation of a volume, the data are considered released to the PDS. The PDS-
PPI is then responsible for duplicating the approved volume as PDS requires
for both distribution and the deep archive at NSSDC.

Distribution of the RPWS standard product archive volumes is the
responsibility of the PDS. The PPI maintains a mailing list of scientists
interested in receiving these data. Users can add or remove themselves from
the Cassini RPWS distribution list through a web page maintained at the PPI.
The NSSDC may choose to order (and pay for) additional copies at the time PDS
generates them or orders copies from a vendor. The NSSDC and the PDS are each
separately responsible for making additional future copies to meet the needs
of their user communities.

In the event that a volume is found to contain errors, the reviewers can
recommend one of two courses of action: fix the disk or publish as is with a
note in the ERRATA.TXT file. If the errors are minor, typically minor errors
in the documentation, the volume can be published if the appropriate notes are
added to the volume=s errata file and the error(s) are corrected on subsequent
volumes. If the errors are major, typically involving errors in the data
themselves, then the volume must be corrected, re-generated, and sent back out
for review.

## 3.2. Data Product Sizes and Delivery Dates

Table 2 summarizes sizes and delivery rates for the Cassini RPWS Standard
Products. It should be noted that the Cassini/Huygens Program Archive Plan for
Science Data specifies the schedule for archive product delivery. Essentially,
all cruise and approach products up until SOI are due on 1 July 2005 and
subsequent tour data will be delivered in three-month increments every
quarter.

The current plan is for each RPWS Standard Product Archive Volume to contain
at most ~4.7 Gbytes of data, including documentation and ancillary files,
based on the storage capacity of DVD-R media. Some volumes may be under-filled
to keep the time intervals covered by a given volume at reasonable sizes and
to cover standard intervals (e.g. 1 year or 1 month). We anticipate including
all of the data types in Tables 1 and 2 for a given interval on the same
volume.

According to the archive schedule, we estimate approximately 4 DVD-R volumes
will encompass the cruise phase and be delivered by 1 July 2005. We anticipate
delivering approximately 3 DVD-Rs per quarter, thereafter. The most recent
data in a delivery will be approximately 1 year old, the time required to
generate and validate the delivered data.

## 3.3 Interface Media Characteristics

All DVD volumes in the Cassini RPWS Standard Product Archive Collection will
conform to the Digital Versatile Disk UDF-ISO Bridge format (with ISO-9660
level 2 compatibility).

## 3.4 Backup and Duplicates

UCLA keeps three copies of each DVD-R volume. One volume is the archive copy
and is placed in an on-line drive at UCLA in order to make the data web
accessible. The second copy is a backup that can be used if a DVD-R becomes
lost or damaged. The third copy is a copy to be kept offsite from UCLA. UCLA
will make copies of the one DVD-R provided by the University of Iowa to
fulfill these needs. Another copy is sent to the NSSDC. The University of Iowa
will keep at least one copy of each DVD-R.

## 3.5 Labeling and Identification

Each Cassini RPWS DVD-R bears a volume ID using the last two components of the
volume set ID [PDS Standards Reference, 2002]. The RPWS volume set is
comprised of one sequence of volumes with the volume set ID of
USA_NASA_PDS_CORPWS_0nnn. The RPWS volumes will be members of the MISSION TO
SATURN volume series.
