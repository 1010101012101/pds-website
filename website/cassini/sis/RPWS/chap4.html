## 4.5 BROWSE Directory Contents and Naming Conventions

The Browse directory contains frequency-time spectrogram images of the full-
resolution numerical data for the Key Parameters, Low Rate, Wideband, and
Waveform data sets and ancillary information files produced by the RPWS team.
The image files, in Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, from the various
data sets are stored in separate subdirectories on the main data directory.

### 4.5.1 Required Files

In the BROWSE directory there is a file named BROWINFO.TXT that is an ASCII
text description of the contents of the directory and its subdirectories. Text
documentation files will have attached PDS labels. One detached PDS label file
will describe all of the image files in the BROWSE directory and its
subdirectories, and has the suffix A.LBL@.

### 4.5.2 BROWSE/RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS Directory Contents

Low Rate Browse (RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS_BROWSE) consists of Portable Network
Graphics (PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the low rate key parameter
spectral information observed by the RPWS. There will be two image files for
each day for which data exists. One will include the electric field
spectrogram and the other will include the magnetic field spectrogram. File
names will be of the form Tyyyyddd_E_KPB.PNG and Tyyyyddd_B_KPB.PNG where
yyyyddd is the date of the data.

### 4.5.3 BROWSE/RPWS_LOW_RATE_FULL Directory Contents

Low Rate Browse (RPWS_LOW_RATE_BROWSE) consists of Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the low rate spectral information
observed by the RPWS. There will be two image files for each day for which
data exists. One will include the electric field spectrogram and the other
will include the magnetic field spectrogram. File names will be of the form
Tyyyyddd_E_LRB.PNG and Tyyyyddd_B_LRB.PNG where yyyyddd is the date of the
data.

### 4.5.4 BROWSE/RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL Directory Contents

Wideband Browse (RPWS_WIDEBAND_BROWSE) consists of Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the wideband observations acquired
by the RPWS. Subsets of this data set will include data in the 10- and 80-kHz
wideband receiver data (baseband) and high-frequency wideband receiver data
acquired via frequency translation through the High Frequency Receiver from
frequencies between 125 kHz and 16 MHz. Since these data are typically
acquired for brief intervals with long time intervals in between, there will
be one file for each acquisition interval. File names will be of the form
Tyyyyddd_hhmm_xxxKHZ_WBRFR.PNG where yyyyddd_hhmm is the starting date and
time of the included data and xxx refers to the analysis band such as 10K,
75K, 125K, 8025K. The 10-kHz and 75-kHz files will be segregated into separate
directories. The frequency-translated data will be in another separate
directory, although this directory will include any analysis band other than
10- or 75-kHz.

### 4.5.5 BROWSE/RPWS_WAVEFORM_FULL Directory Contents

Waveform Browse (RPWS_WAVEFORM_BROWSE) data are of Portable Network Graphics
(PNG) frequency-time spectrogram images of the 5-Channel Waveform Receiver
observations acquired by the RPWS. There will be one file per day for each
analysis bandwidth (26 Hz or 2.5 kHz). File names will be of the form
Tyyyyddd_26HZ_WFRFR.PNG or Tyyyyddd_2_5KHZ_WFRFR.PNG where yyyyddd is the date
of the data.

## 4.6 DATA Directory Contents and Naming Conventions

The Data directory contains the actual data products and ancillary information
files produced by the RPWS team. The data files from the various data sets are
stored in separate subdirectories on the main data directory.

### 4.6.1 Required Files

The DATA directory contains a description of the contents of all of the
subdirectories in a file called DATAINFO.TXT. Text documentation files will
have attached PDS labels and data files will have detached labels. Detached
PDS label files have the same root name as the file they describe, but have
the suffix A.LBL@. In directories where there are multiple files with the same
internal table structure, the table column description is included in a single
format file (.FMT) that is referenced by a pointer within the PDS label files.
This prevents the needless repetition of information that is not changing
within the PDS label files. In directories where uncalibrated data are
provided, files required for calibrating the data are included (.CAL).

### 4.6.2 DATA/RPWS_RAW_COMPLETE Directory Contents

Raw Complete (RPWS_RAW_COMPLETE) is a data set which includes all RPWS
telemetry data in a reformatted telemetry packet form. Since much of the RPWS
data is compressed on the spacecraft, this data set includes uncompressed data
so that a user would not have to determine how to correctly uncompress several
different types of data using different compression schemes. Also, since the
RPWS telemetry packets include a secondary level of organization we refer to
as minipackets (an RPWS minipacket includes telemetry from a single RPWS
receiver for a given interval of time, usually a measurement cycle), and since
the minipackets can be segmented - split across original telemetry packets, we
have unsegmented these and made sure that all the data for a given minipacket
is in one cohesive structure. Because of these simplifications, the
reformatted telemetry packets are not fixed length and are not well-suited to
description by PDS labeling standards. Also, since all of these data are
archived in either calibrated or at least further reformatted into fixed-
length records with standard PDS labeling elsewhere, we have included only
minimal PDS labels for these records. Documentation (the RPWS Software Users
Guide) included in the DOCUMENT directory provide information on how to
extract and use data from this data set, should that extraordinary
circumstance arise. There will be one file per hour (for hours during which
data exist with file names of the form Tyyyyddd_hh_RAW.PKT where yyyyddd_hh is
the year and day of year of the data and hh is the hour of the day of the
data.

### 4.6.3 DATA/RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS Directory Contents

Key Parameters (RPWS_KEY_PARAMETERS) is a data set which contains a summary of
the RPWS spectral information as a function of time with parameters which have
been agreed to between RPWS and other MAPS instruments as being suitable for
the RPWS contribution to the MAPS Key Parameter Data Set. This parameter set
is in the form of an ASCII flat file including the amplitude (electric and
magnetic field spectral densities) of waves in 10 logarithmically-spaced
frequency bands per decade of frequency with 1-minute temporal resolution and
is generated by averaging full resolution measurements falling within the
frequency and time bins. There will be one file per day for days when data
exist. File names will be of the form RPWS_KEY__yyyyddd_v.TAB where yyyyddd is
the date of the data and v is the version. Note that this version represents
the number of times the file has been written and is not to be confused with
the PDS product version or data set version.

### 4.6.4 DATA/RPWS_LOW_RATE_FULL Directory Contents

Low Rate Full Resolution Calibrated (RPWS_LOW_RATE_FULL) is a data set
including all spectral density measurements acquired by the RPWS in units of
electric or magnetic field spectral density. For days when data exist, there
will be a minimum of 3 files per day. One of these files will include data
from the Low Frequency Receiver (LFR), one will include data from the Medium
Frequency Receiver (MFR), and one will include data from the High Frequency
Receiver (HFR). There may be a fourth file which includes data from the Medium
Frequency Digital Receiver (MFDR). This last data source is similar to that
from the LFR except that is derived from the 2.5-kHz mode of the waveform
receiver and can be used to replace or supplement the data from the MFR. Each
file will contain a binary table with columns for time (both SCET and SCLK),
sensor, and an array of spectral densities for the set of frequency channels
described in the file header. When mode changes result in a change in this set
of channels, a different file for that receiver will be used. This is most
likely for the HFR, since the HFR has extensive flexibility. File names will
be of the forms

Tyyyyddd_LFRn.DAT,  
  
---  
  
Tyyyyddd_MFRn.DAT,  
  
Tyyyyddd_HFRn.DAT, and  
  
Tyyyyddd_MFDRn.DAT  
  
for the four types of files described above, respectively. In each, yyyyddd is
the date of the data. For each &gt;n= is incremented from 0 for each different
set of channel configurations for that receiver.

### 4.6.5 DATA/RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL Directory Contents

Wideband Full Resolution Uncalibrated (RPWS_WIDEBAND_FULL) data are the full
resolution waveform data from the RPWS Wideband Receiver in uncalibrated form.
This data set will include procedures, code examples, and the necessary
information to derive calibrated electric or magnetic field spectral densities
from the uncalibrated data. There will be at least one file for each hour when
data exist. Data having different analysis frequency bands will be in separate
files. Further, different files will be used when the number of samples in a
time series is different within the same hour. This is so each file will have
fixed-length records. File names will be of the forms:

Tyyyyddd_hh_10KHZn_WBRFR.DAT  
  
---  
  
Tyyyyddd_hh_75KHZn_WBRFR.DAT  
  
Tyyyyddd_hh_xxxKHZn_WBRFR.DAT  
  
where yyyyddd is the date of the data, hh is the hour of the data, and xxx is
the frequency band when frequency translated data are used, such as 125, 8025,
etc. The n differentiates between files with different record lengths as
follows:

n

Dust waveform (1024 bytes)  
  
In addition to the above data lengths, there are 32 bytes of status in each
record.

### 4.6.6 DATA/RPWS_WAVEFORM_FULL Directory Contents

Waveform Full Resolution Uncalibrated (RPWS_WAVEFORM_FULL) data are the full
resolution waveform data from the RPWS Wideband Receiver in uncalibrated form.
This data set will include procedures, code examples, and the necessary
information to derive calibrated electric and magnetic field spectral
densities from the uncalibrated data. There will be one file per day for each
of the two analysis bandwidths (25 Hz or 2.5kHz). Different files will be used
when the number of samples in the time series is different, so as to have
fixed-length records in the files. File names will be of the forms

Tyyyyddd_26HZ_WFFRn.DAT and  
  
---  
  
Tyyyyddd_2_5KHZ_WFFRn.DAT  
  
where yyyyddd is the date of the data. The n differentiates between files with
different record lengths as follows:

n

|

Record Data Length (bytes)  
  
---|---

6144  
  
8

|

8192  
  
9

|

20480  
  
In addition to the above data lengths, there are 32 bytes of status in each
record. Note that in this data set, data from all of the sensors (whether 1,
2, 3, or 5) are contained in the same file; a parameter in each record gives
the sensor for that particular waveform time series.

### 4.6.7 DATA/ANCILLARY Directory Contents

The primary contents of this directory will be instrument operation and
sequence information which is useful in finding and using the data in this
archive. For each sequence, there will be an overview TXT file which will list
the set of Instrument Expanded Blocks (IEBs) used in the sequence and a brief,
one line, description of each IEB and a pointer to a TXT file providing a
detailed description of the IEB. For each sequence there will also be a TAB
file containing a set of Spacecraft Event Time (SCET) time tags, IEB Trigger
number or other RPWS command mnemonic or short description of a series of
commands (e.g. a series of IEB load commands) which can be used to understand
which IEB was invoked at which times.

Note that we assume that the full set of SPICE kernels are being archived by
NAIF; we do not propose to duplicate those archives within the RPWS archive.

## 4.7 EXTRAS Directory Contents

This directory contains volume navigation HTML files or other files which
facilitate the use of the volume, but which are not considered part of the
archive, itself.
