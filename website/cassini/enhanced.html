### Enhanced Cassini Support

During FY12, PDS worked closely with the Cassini mission and instrument teams
to develop material to make it easier to find and use Cassini data. Some of
those enhancements are available at the Rings Node where most of our focus is
on the optical remote sensing instruments. If you don't find what you need in
our pages, please check the [PDS's Cassini Archive Page](http://atmos.nmsu.edu
/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini.html) which has been
established as an overall clearing house for Cassini support.

###  Enhanced support available at the Rings Node:

  * **Preview products and the keys to their interpretation**

    The PDS Rings Node generates browse images or footprint diagrams for data at
    the Rings Node. These are used in the results gallery view for [OPUS](http
    ://pds-rings-tools.seti.org/opus/). Links to preview products for each volume
    are provided in the "Access Data" pages of the respective instrument
    information pages. You may browse through our entire collection of browse
    products [here.](/browse)

    We attempt to convey a lot of information, so intrepreting our preview
    products, especially for data submitted in cube form, can be challenging. Here
    are keys to assist in their interpretion.

  * **Preview Product Keys**

    * Image previews are tinted based on filter(s) used - from violet for relatively short wavelengths to red for relatively long wavelengths.
    * [Key for Cassini CIRS previews](/cassini/cirs/COCIRS_previews.txt)
    * [Key for Cassini UVIS previews](/cassini/uvis/UVIS_previews.txt)
    * [Key for Cassini VIMS previews](/cassini/vims/COVIMS_previews.txt)


  * **Calibrated ISS images**

    * Links to calibrated images by volume are available from the table on the [Aceessing ISS Data](/cassini/iss/access.html) page. 


  * **Cassini Occultaton Data Sets**

    * UVIS stellar occultation profiles of Saturn's rings, available from our [UVIS information pages](/cassini/uvis/index.html). 
    * VIMS stellar occultation profiles of Saturn's rings, available from our [VIMS information pages](/cassini/vims/index.html). 
    * RSS radio occultation profiles of Saturn's rings, available from our [RSS information pages](/cassini/rss/index.html). 

  * **New or updated data user's guides**

    * CIRS Data User Guide - released in November 2012. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/cirs/CIRS-User-Guide_v11.6-public.pdf)
    * ISS Data User's Guide - released in July 2012. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/iss/ISS_Data_User_Guide_120703.pdf) or [MS Office .docx](/cassini/iss/ISS_Data_User_Guide_120703.docx). 
    * RSS Data User Guide - released in September 2014. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/rss/Cassini Radio Science Users Guide - 4 Sep 2014.pdf)
    * UVIS User's Guide - updated in June 2014. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/uvis/UVIS_Users_Guide_v2.pdf) or [MS Office .docx](/cassini/uvis/UVIS_Users_Guide_v2.docx). 

  * **Downloadable tables of enhanced geometric metadata**

    The PDS Rings Node generates detailed metadata about Saturn and its satellites
    to support searches using [OPUS](http://pds-rings-tools.seti.org/opus/).
    Tables of that metadata are available for downloading.

**Update February 2015:**

We updated our pipeline and regenerated all previous metadata files.
Improvements include:

  * more accurate ring information,
  * fewer missing files due to gaps in the C kernels,
  * corrected timing of the VIMS cubes.

The metadata is organized by data volume for each instrument (e.g., ISS volume
2001 has a set of tables). For each volume we provide three tables with their
associated PDS labels which include column descriptions. The three tables
provide geometric metadata for the moons of Saturn, the Rings of Saturn, and
for Saturn. The tables are updated quarterly shortly after we receive the
Cassini quarterly delivery.

You can browse the tables on-line and download individual tables, download the
set of tables for a specific volume as a tar.gz file, or download the entire
set for one instrument as a single tar.gz file. In addition, links to geometry
tables for each volume are provided in the "Access Data" pages of the
respective Instrument information pages. For information on opening tar.gz
files, click [here.](/targzip.htm)
