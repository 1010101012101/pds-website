### Enhanced Cassini Support

During FY12, PDS worked closely with the Cassini mission and instrument teams
to develop material to make it easier to find and use Cassini data. Some of
those enhancements are available at the Rings Node where most of our focus is
on the optical remote sensing instruments. If you don't find what you need in
our pages, please check the [PDS's Cassini Archive Page](http://atmos.nmsu.edu
/data_and_services/atmospheres_data/Cassini/Cassini.html) which has been
established as an overall clearing house for Cassini support.

###  Enhanced support available at the Rings Node:

  * **Preview products and the keys to their interpretation**

    The PDS Rings Node generates browse images or footprint diagrams for data at
    the Rings Node. These are used in the results gallery view for [OPUS](http://tools.pds-rings.seti.org/opus). Links to preview products for each volume
    are provided in the "Access Data" pages of the respective instrument
    information pages. You may browse through our entire collection of browse
    products [here.](/browse)

    We attempt to convey a lot of information, so intrepreting our preview
    products, especially for data submitted in cube form, can be challenging. Here
    are keys to assist in their interpretion.

  * **Preview Product Keys**

    * Image previews are tinted based on filter(s) used - from violet for relatively short wavelengths to red for relatively long wavelengths.
    * [Key for Cassini CIRS previews](/cassini/cirs/COCIRS_previews.txt)
    * [Key for Cassini UVIS previews](/cassini/uvis/UVIS_previews.txt)
    * [Key for Cassini VIMS previews](/cassini/vims/COVIMS_previews.txt)


  * **Calibrated ISS images**

    * Links to calibrated Jupiter encounter images by volume are available from the table on the [Accessing ISS Cruise Data](/cassini/iss/access_cruise.html) page.
    * Links to calibrated Saturn encounter images by volume are available from the table on the [Accessing ISS Data](/cassini/iss/access.html) page.
    * The images are also available for browsing in the [Derived Directory](/derived/),
    * and as .tar.gz files for downloading by volume in the [Derived Archives Directory](/derived/archives/).

  * **Cassini Occultaton Data Sets**

    * UVIS stellar occultation profiles of Saturn's rings, available from our [UVIS information pages](/cassini/uvis/index.html).
    * VIMS stellar occultation profiles of Saturn's rings, available from our [VIMS information pages](/cassini/vims/index.html).
    * RSS radio occultation profiles of Saturn's rings, available from our [RSS information pages](/cassini/rss/index.html).

  * **New or updated data user's guides**

    * CIRS Data User Guide - updated in May 2017. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/cirs/CIRS-User-Guide_v11.6-5-3-17.pdf)
    * ISS Data User's Guide - updated in September 2016. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/iss/iss_data_user_guide_160929.pdf).
    * RSS Data User Guide - released in September 2014. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/rss/Cassini Radio Science Users Guide - 4 Sep 2014.pdf)
    * UVIS User's Guide - updated in May 2017. [Adobe .pdf](/cassini/uvis/UVIS_Users_Guide_v2_5-3-17).

  * **Downloadable tables of enhanced geometric metadata**

    The PDS Rings Node generates detailed metadata about Saturn and its satellites
    to support searches using [OPUS](http://tools.pds-rings.seti.org/opus). We currently produce
    supplemental metadata for Cassini ISS, UVIS, and VIMS. CIRS metadata may be available near
    the end of FY16.

    [Tables of that metadata are available](http://pds-rings.seti.org/metadata/) for
    browsing and downloading. Each instrument subdirectory contains browsable metadata by volume.

    tar.gz files for each volume are in the /archives/ subdirectory of the relevant instrument
    directory - e.g., metadata/COISS_2xxx/archives/. For information on opening tar.gz
    files, click [here.](/targzip.htm)

    The metadata is organized by data volume for each instrument (e.g., ISS volume
    2001 has a set of tables). For each volume we provide four tables with their
    associated PDS labels which include column descriptions. Three of the tables
    provide geometric metadata for the moons of Saturn, the Rings of Saturn, and
    for Saturn. The fourth table, nnnn_index.tab, list all of the detectable (e.g.,
    satellites completly obscured behind the planet are not included) targets
    in the instrument field of view.

    The tables are updated quarterly shortly after we receive the
    Cassini quarterly delivery.
