###  New, October 2012: VIMS Stellar Occultation Profiles

  * The PDS Rings node has posted a new data set of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from VIMS radio occultation data. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 60 high quality VIMS occultations. The data set is still being compiled and has not undergone lien resolution. 

** Since the data has not completed lien resolution, users should exercise caution when using the data.**

  * Users may browse the lien resolution version of the occultation data set [COVIMS_8001](/link/volumes/COVIMS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COVIMS_8001/),
or download the entire data set
[COVIMS_8001.tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/COVIMS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COVIMS_8001.tar.gz). 

  * Please [ contact us](/cgi-bin/comments/form.pl? if you encounter difficulties with the data, identify errors in the data set, or have suggestions for improvement of the data set. 

### Getting the Data You Want

The table below contains temporal coverage information for, and links to, all
of the available VIMS data volumes from cruise, Jupiter, and Saturn.

  * **Review** a volume on-line by clicking the volume ID. 

  * **Download** an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second table. 

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.

  * **PREVIEW** will take you to a directory containing sub-directories of preview images for each VIMS cube in the volume. 

The preview images contain a wealth of information. The key for the preview
images is in <a href="COVIMS_previews.txt" target="_blank">COVIMS_previews.txt</a>.

### Available Volumes

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.
