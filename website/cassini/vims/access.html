  * In addition to the raw data referenced below, the PDS RMS node has a data set of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from VIMS stellar occultation data obtained during the prime mission (2004-2008). The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 60 VIMS stellar occultations. The data set has not completed peer review lien resolution. 

    **Since the data has not completed lien resolution, users should exercise caution when using the data.**

  * Users may browse the lien resolution data set
    **[COVIMS_8001](/link/volumes/COVIMS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COVIMS_8001/)**, or download the
    entire data set [COVIMS_8001.tar.gz](/link/archives-volumes/COVIMS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COVIMS_8001.tar.gz).


### Getting the Data You Want

The table below contains temporal coverage information for, and links to, all
of the available VIMS data volumes from cruise, Jupiter, and Saturn.

  * Browse a volume on-line by clicking the volume ID. 

  * Download an entire volume, by right clicking on that volume's "Bundled" link in the second table. 

The bundled volumes are provided in [tar.gz](/help/targz.html) format.

  * Browse Images will take you to a directory containing sub-directories of preview images for each VIMS cube in the volume. 

The preview images contain a wealth of information. The key for the preview
images is in <a href="COVIMS_previews.txt" target="_blank">COVIMS_previews.txt</a>.

### Available Volumes

  * The dates at the beginning of each section in the table below correspond to **the scheduled delivery to PDS.**

  * To determine which volumes meet the publicly available criteria for a specific ROSES Announcement please see the appropriate DAP page under our [Proposal Support](/roses) pages.
