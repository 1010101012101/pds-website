## Overview

The archive of Cassini Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) data is
a single, multi-volume set that will span the entire mission. The archive
volumes contain VIMS data products, instrument documentation, calibration
files, calibration algorithms and documentation necessary to produce higher
level calibrated products.

###  Update May 2014: VIMS Stellar Occultation Profiles

  * The PDS Rings node has posted a dataset of Saturn ring radial profiles derived from VIMS radio occultation data. The data include ring radial profiles at 1 and 10 km resolution from more than 60 high quality VIMS occultations. The dataset has completed peer review and is now in lien resolution. Although there are a few liens against the dataset, it is PDS certified and is eligible for use under some [ROSES 2014](/roses/) programs. 

  * Users may browse the dataset [COVIMS_8001](/vol/COVIMS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COVIMS_8001/), or download the entire dataset [COVIMS_8001 tar.gz](/archives/COVIMS_8xxx_lien_resolution/COVIMS_8001.tar.gz).

The tabs associated with this page describe the VIMS data files and how to
obtain and use them.

  * [Finding Data](finding.html) \- Suggestions on how to search the archive for specific data.
  * [Accessing Data](access.html) \- Links to the data volumes.
  * [VIMS Calibration](calibration.html) \- Discussion of, and links to, available VIMS calibration files and software.

### Data Analysis Software

  * VIMS QUBES are compatible with the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) software package which is available through the [ USGS Flagstaff web site.](http://isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/)

  * The USGS has developed a VIMS calibration pipeline. This pipeline is derived from the software provided by the team, upgraded to be compatible with ISIS3.

  * Developing a local calibration pipeline based on the software provided on the VIMS volumes has proven challenging; consequently, users are strongly encouraged to explore the suitability of the USGS pipeline first. NOTE: VIMS pipeline scripts provided on the data volumes are compatible with ISIS2, not ISIS3.

  * Another data analysis tool, CAVIAR, is in development and may be made available at some point in the future. It operates under IDL and can be run under IDL VM software which is available at no cost. It will be useful for both ISS and VIMS data analysis. We will supply links to the appropriate pages when they become available.
