## Software

**Two types of software are available or are in development for general release:**

### 1\. Calibration Software

  * The [software](/vol/COVIMS_0xxx/COVIMS_0001/SOFTWARE/) directory on each volume provides calibration software and details of the calibration process.

  * The [calibration](/vol/COVIMS_0xxx/COVIMS_0001/CALIB/) directory on each volume provides calibration files and sample calibrated VIMS Qubes.

  * The contents of a set of VIMS software and calibration directories is available as a [.tar.gz bundle](./vims_calib.tar.gz). This bundle collects the information needed to establish a local VIMS calibration pipeline. The software provided by the team requires the use of the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) software package which is available through the [ USGS Flagstaff web site.](//isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/) **WARNING: The pipeline scripts included in the software directory are compatible with ISIS 2. They are not compatible with ISIS 3**. 

### 2\. Data Analysis Software

  * VIMS QUBES are compatible with the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) software package which is available through the [ USGS Flagstaff web site.](//isis.astrogeology.usgs.gov/) **WARNING: The pipeline scripts included in the software directory are compatible with ISIS 2. They are not compatible with ISIS 3**. 

  * Another data analysis tool, CAVIAR, is in development and will be made available in the near future. It operates under IDL and can be run under IDL VM software which is available at no cost. It will be useful for both ISS and VIMS data analysis. We will supply links to the appropriate pages when they become available.
