# Build Tools

Our legacy website was a giant flat file html site. We used Aaron Swartz's [html2text](https://github.com/aaronsw/html2text) python library to convert the old site to markdown for loading into a modern [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) website. 

# Usage 

first copy the legacy site into original_site

then run the converter, see conversions/README.md

that puts the files into converted_markdown
