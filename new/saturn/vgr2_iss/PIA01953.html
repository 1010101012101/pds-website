The outer edge of Saturn's A ring is detailed in this image obtained by
Voyager 2 on Aug. 26, just half an hour before closest approach, at a range of
about 51,000 kilometers (31,700 miles). Resolution in this wide-angle view is
about 4 km. (2.5 miles). The many sharp linear features parallel to the ring
edge are most probably locations where ring particles are in
[resonance](/glossary.html#resonance) with one of the several small nearby
satellites of about 100-km. radius discovered last fall by Voyager 1. Such
regions are likely characterized by more intense particle collisions and a
greater density of small "chips." The entire outer band of the A ring has
different scattering properties and therefore different particle
characteristics than the main body of the rings to the upper left. The Voyager
project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
