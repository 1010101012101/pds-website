**Caption: **

Voyager 2 took this high-resolution image of Saturn's F ring Aug. 26 from a
distance of 51,500 kilometers (32,000 miles). This closeup view shows that the
ring is made up of at least four distinct components. A higher-resolution scan
through the F ring, the result of the star
[occultation](/glossary.html#occultation) experiment conducted by the
spacecraft's photopolarimeter, showed even finer structure in the ring.
Voyager 1 showed a braiding effect not evident in this picture. The small
black dots are [reseau](/glossary.html#reseau) (reference) marks on the
camera. The small bright dash in the middle right of the image is a star
trail. The Voyager project is managed for NASA by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
