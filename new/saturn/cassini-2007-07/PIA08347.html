The great planet Saturn reveals mysteries more profound, and stories more
grand, than those occasioned by its ancient mythological namesake.

The giant planet is a moody world whose disposition appears to change with the
view. Its atmosphere rages with thunderous and hurricane-like storms. Its
majestic rings spin a tale of ancient collisions and cataclysm. And its moons
may hold secrets to the origins of life.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 28 degrees below
the ring plane.

The image was taken using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of
infrared light centered at 890 nanometers. The view was acquired with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 30, 2007, at a distance of
approximately 1.1 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 60 kilometers (38 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
