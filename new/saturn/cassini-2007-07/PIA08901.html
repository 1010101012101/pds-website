The Cassini Division appears to emerge out of Saturn's shadow in this Cassini
spacecraft image. This division between the A and B rings, visible through
modest telescopes from Earth, actually contains five dim bands of ring
material, here seen near the left side of the image between two small dark
gaps.

This detailed view also displays a great deal of structure in the B ring, left
of the division. The Cassini Division is 4,800 kilometers (2,980 miles) wide.

This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 59 degrees above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 9, 2007 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
