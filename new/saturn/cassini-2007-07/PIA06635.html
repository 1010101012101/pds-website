The small ring moon Atlas is seen here, on the far side of Saturn's immense
ring system. Cassini was only 0.6 degrees above the ring plane when this image
was taken. Atlas is 32 kilometers (20 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 11, 2005, at a distance of approximately 1.5 million
kilometers (957,000 miles) from Atlas and at a Sun-Atlas-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 100 degrees. Resolution in the original image was 9 kilometers (6
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
