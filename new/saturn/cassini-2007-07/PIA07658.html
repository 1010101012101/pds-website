Dione is partly occulted by Saturn's rings in this nearly edge-on view, taken
from less than a tenth of a degree above the ringplane. The side of the rings
nearer to the Cassini spacecraft was masked by Saturn's shadow at the time and
appears dark.

Bright, wispy fractures on Dione's trailing hemisphere curl around the
horizon. Sunlit terrain seen on Dione (1,126 kilometers, 700 miles across) is
on the moon's Saturn-facing hemisphere. North is up.

The image was taken in infrared light (centered at 752 nanometers) with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Nov. 3, 2005 at a distance of
approximately 2.5 million kilometers (1.5 million miles) from Dione and at a
Sun-Dione-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 109 degrees. Resolution in the
original image was 15 kilometers (9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
