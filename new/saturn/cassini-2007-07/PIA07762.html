Jets of icy particles burst from Saturn's moon Enceladus in this brief movie
sequence of four images taken on Nov. 27, 2005. The sensational discovery of
active eruptions on a third outer solar system body (after Jupiter's moon, Io,
and Neptune's moon, Triton) is one of the great highlights of the Cassini
mission.

Images taken in January 2005, appeared to show the plume originating from the
fractured south polar region of Enceladus, but the visible plume was only
slightly brighter than the background noise in the image because the lighting
geometry was not suitable to reveal the true details of the feature. This
potential sighting, in addition to the detection of the icy particles in the
plume by other Cassini instruments, prompted imaging scientists to target
Enceladus again with exposures designed to confirm the validity of the earlier
plume sighting.

The new views show individual jets, or plume sources, that contribute to the
plume with much greater visibility than the earlier images. The full plume
towers over the 505-kilometer-wide (314-mile) moon, and is at least as tall as
the moon's diameter.

The four, 10-second exposures were taken over the course of about 36 minutes
at approximately 12-minute intervals. Enceladus rotates about 7.5 degrees in
longitude over the course of the frames, and most of the observed changes in
the appearances of the jets are likely due to changes in the viewing geometry.
However, some of the changes may be due to actual variation in the flow from
the jets on a time scale of tens of minutes.

Additionally, the shift of the sources seen here should provide information
about their location in front of and behind the visible limb (edge) of
Enceladus.

These images were obtained using the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera at
distances between 144,350 and 149,520 kilometers (89,695 and 92,907 miles)
from Enceladus and at a phase angle of about 161 degrees. Image scale is about
900 meters (2,950 feet) per pixel on Enceladus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
