In a dazzling and dramatic portrait painted by the Sun, the long thin shadows
of Saturn's rings sweep across the planet's northern latitudes. Within the
shadows, bright bands represent areas where the ring material is less dense,
while dark strips and wave patterns reveal areas of denser material.

The shadow darkens sharply near upper right, corresponding to the boundary of
the thin C ring with the denser B ring. A wide-field, natural color view of
these shadows can be seen in
[PIA06164](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06164).

The globe of Saturn's moon Mimas (398 kilometers, or 247 miles across) has
wandered into view near the bottom of the frame. A few of the large craters on
this small moon are visible.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera on Jan.
18, 2005, at a distance of 1.4 million kilometers (889,000 miles) from Saturn
using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at 752
nanometers. The image scale is 9 kilometers (5.5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
