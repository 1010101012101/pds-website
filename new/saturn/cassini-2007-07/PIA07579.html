From just outside the faint edge of Saturn's F ring, the moon Pandora keeps
watch over her fine-grained flock. The outer flanks of the F ring region are
populated by ice particles approaching the size of the particles comprising
smoke. As a shepherd moon, Pandora helps her cohort Prometheus confine and
shape the main F ring. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

Prometheus is 102 kilometers (63 miles) wide and orbits interior to the F
ring.

The small knot seen attached to the core is one of several that Cassini
scientists are eyeing as they attempt to distinguish embedded moons from
transient clumps of material (see
[PIA07716](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07716)).

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 2,
2005, using a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
930 nanometers at a distance of approximately 610,000 kilometers (379,000
miles) from Pandora and at a Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 146
degrees. Image scale is 4 kilometers (2 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL.
