Cassini spied the moon Enceladus in the distance beyond Saturn's south pole in
this image from Sept. 19, 2004.

This view was taken in wavelengths of ultraviolet light where gas molecules in
Saturn's high atmosphere scatter a great deal of sunlight. Since Enceladus
(499 kilometers, or 310 miles, across) has an unusually high reflectivity, its
surface reflects even more of the light falling on it than Saturn does, making
the moon appear very bright compared the planet. Enceladus was dimmed in
brightness by a factor of three during processing of the image, in order to
make its brightness comparable to that of Saturn.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle camera at a
distance of 8.3 million kilometers (5.2 million miles) from Saturn. The image
scale is 49 kilometers (30 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington,
D.C. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed
and assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
