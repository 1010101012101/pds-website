The shepherd moon, Pandora, is seen here alongside the narrow F ring that it
helps maintain. Pandora is 84 kilometers (52 miles) across.

Cassini obtained this view from about four degrees above the ringplane.
Captured here are several faint, dusty ringlets in the vicinity of the F ring
core. The ringlets do not appear to be perturbed to the degree seen in the
core.

The appearance of Pandora here is exciting, as the moon's complete shape can
be seen, thanks to reflected light from Saturn, which illuminates Pandora's
dark side. The hint of a crater is visible on the dark side of the moon.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 4, 2005, at a distance of approximately 967,000 kilometers
(601,000 miles) from Pandora and at a Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 117 degrees. The image scale is 6 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
