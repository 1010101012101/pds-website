From a viewing angle slightly above the ringplane Cassini spied Saturn's moon
Atlas, which orbits Saturn between the broad A ring and the thin F ring. The
background of Saturn's atmosphere (a uniform grey in this image) lies
approximately 76,000 kilometers (47,000 miles) beyond the little moon. Atlas
is 32 kilometers (20 miles) across.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Feb. 18, 2005, at a distance of approximately 914,000 kilometers
(568,000 miles) from Atlas. Resolution in the original image was 5 kilometers
(3 miles) per pixel. The image has been contrast-enhanced and magnified by a
factor of two to aid visibility.

When viewed from the dark (unlit) side, the rings are essentially an inverse
of their familiar appearance (see
[PIA06259](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06259)) and
[PIA06548](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06548)) to compare the
different views).

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
