When seen from the unlit side, the rings of Saturn present a much different
appearance from that familiar to telescopic observers. Relatively opaque areas
like the B Ring turn black, while lightly populated zones, such as the C Ring
and the Cassini Division, prove to to excellent diffuse transmitters of
sunlight. The A Ring, whith intermediate opacity, is at an intermediate level
of brightness.
