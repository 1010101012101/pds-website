The crescent of Saturn, the planet's rings and their shadows are seen in this
Voyager 1 image taken Nov. 13, 1980 at a distance of 1,500,000 kilometers
(930,000 miles) as the spacecraft began to leave the Saturn system. The bright
limb of Saturn is clearly visible through the A, B, and C rings. The dark band
cutting through the crescent is the shadow of the rings. This image was
overexposed to bring out detail in the rings, so the crescent appears
artificially brighter. The Voyager Project is managed for NASA by the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.
