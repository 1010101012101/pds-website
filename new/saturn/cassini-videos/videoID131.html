This computer simulated view of Saturn from the Cassini spacecraft shows the
relative path of the Sun as it passes behind the planet.

The Cassini spacecraft will be right where scientists studying the rings want
it: far enough from Saturn to be able to image it all and, more importantly,
with the Sun blocked by the planet for 12 hours, long enough to properly map
the elusive microscopic particles moving within the extended ring system.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
