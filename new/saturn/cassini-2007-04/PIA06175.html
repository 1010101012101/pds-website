Saturn's most prominent feature, its dazzling ring system, takes center stage
in this stunning natural color mosaic which reveals the color and diversity
present in this wonder of the solar system. Gaps, gravitational resonances and
wave patterns are all present, and the delicate color variations across the
system are clearly visible.

This mosaic of six images covers a distance of approximately 62,000 kilometers
along the ring plane, from a radius of 74,565 kilometers to 136,780 kilometers
(46,333 to 84,991 miles) from the planet's center.

This view is from Cassini's vantage point beneath the ring plane. The rings
are tilted away from Cassini at an angle of about 4 degrees.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were used to create
this natural color mosaic. The images were acquired using the Cassini
spacecraft narrow angle camera on Dec. 12, 2004, at a distance of
approximately 1.8 million kilometers (1.1 million miles). The image scale is
10.5 kilometers (6.5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
