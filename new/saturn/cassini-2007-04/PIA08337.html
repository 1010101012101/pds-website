Lit by reflected light from Saturn, Enceladus appears to hover above the
gleaming rings, its well-defined ice particle jets spraying a continuous hail
of tiny ice grains. The fine particles coat the moon in a mantle as white as
fresh snow and populate the torus, or doughnut-shaped E ring in which
Enceladus resides.

Beyond Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across), the fine particles in
Saturn's other rings also glow brilliantly in scattered light in this viewing
geometry. Running horizontally across the center of the image, between
Enceladus and the dazzlingly bright F ring, are two faint rings -- kin of the
E ring. These are the G ring (top) and the recently discovered ring designated
R/2006 S1 (bottom), which is also unofficially known as the Janus/Epimetheus
ring.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on March 22, 2006, at a distance of approximately 1.303 million
kilometers (810,000 miles) from Enceladus and at a sun-Enceladus-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 160 degrees. Image scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
