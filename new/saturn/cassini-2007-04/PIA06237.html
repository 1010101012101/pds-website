Cassini's confirmation that a small moon orbits within the Keeler gap in
Saturn's rings is made all the more exciting by this image, in which the disk
of the 7 kilometer-wide body (4-miles) is resolved for the first time.

The new body, provisionally named S/2005 S1, was first seen in a time-lapse
sequence of images taken on May 1, 2005, as Cassini began its climb to higher
elevations in orbit around Saturn (see
[PIA06238](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06238) for the movie).
This view was acquired one day after the discovery sequence of images and has
allowed scientists to measure the moon's size and brightness.

The Keeler gap edges also bear similarities to the scalloped edges of the 322
-kilometer-wide (200-mile) Encke gap, where Pan resides. From the size of the
waves seen in the Encke gap, imaging scientists were able to estimate the mass
of Pan. They expect to do the same eventually with this new moon.

This image was obtained with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May
2, 2005, at a distance of about 594,000 kilometers (369,000 miles) from
Saturn. Cassini was about 525,000 kilometers (326,000 miles) above the
ringplane when the image was taken. Resolution in the original image was 3
kilometers (2 miles) per pixel. The image has been magnified by a factor of
two, and contrast has been enhanced, to aid visibility of the small moonlet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
