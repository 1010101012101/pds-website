One of Saturn's strange co-orbital moons, Epimetheus, was captured by Cassini
in this view. Irregularly shaped Epimetheus occasionally swaps orbits with
nearby Janus (see
[PIA06603](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06603)), and both moons
play a role in maintaining the outer edge of Saturn's bright A ring.
Epimetheus is 116 kilometers (72 miles) across.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Jan. 22, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.5 million kilometers
(1.6 million miles) from Epimetheus and at a Sun-Epimetheus-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 90 degrees. Resolution in the image is 15 kilometers (9 miles)
per pixel. The image has been contrast-enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
