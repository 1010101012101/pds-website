A new found ring of material, S/2004 1 R, in the orbit of Saturn's moon Atlas
has been seen in this view of the region between the edge of Saturn's A ring
and the F ring.

The image was taken by the Cassini spacecraft wide angle camera on July 1,
2004, just after the spacecraft had crossed the ring plane following Saturn
orbit insertion.

The maximum radial resolution is approximately 7 kilometers (4 miles) per
pixel. The region from the A ring to the F ring spans some 3,500 kilometers
(2,200 miles). The image has been enhanced to show the presence of faint ring
material just beyond the edge of the A ring and in the orbit of Atlas
(indicated by the red line in the image on the right). The moon Prometheus
(102 kilometers or 63 miles across) can be seen close to the F ring at the
lower left of the image.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
