This is a rare view of Saturn's rings seen just after the Sun has set below
the ring plane, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope on Nov. 21, 1995.

This perspective is unusual because the Earth is slightly above (2.7 degrees
latitude) Saturn's rings and the Sun is below them. Normally we see the rings
fully illuminated by the Sun.

The photograph shows three bright ring features: the F Ring, the Cassini
Division, and the C Ring (moving from the outer rings to the inner). The low
concentration of material in these rings allows light from the Sun to shine
through them. The A and B rings are much denser, which limits the amount of
light that penetrates through them. Instead, they are faintly visible because
they reflect light from Saturn's disk.

Scientists believe that the F Ring is slightly warped because it disappears
part way around on the right (West) side. Hubble's high resolution shows the
that A Ring's shadow obscures part of the F ring (right).

The image was assembled from 20 exposures taken with Wide Field Planetary
Camera-2 over 8 hours.

The Wide Field/Planetary Camera 2 was developed by the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory and managed by the Goddard Spaced Flight Center for NASA's Office
of Space Science.
