Both the limb of Saturn and the shadow of its ring system are seen through the
transparent C-ring in this striking picture taken by NASA's Voyager 1 on Nov.
9, 1980 at a distance of 4.5 million kilometers (3 million miles). Gaps and
regions of high transparency are seen throughout the C-ring, especially in the
area closest to the opaque B-ring. Shadows of the A-, B-, and C- rings are
clearly visible on the disk of Saturn. The C-ring shadow showing the gaps
described above is the uppermost shadow; below this is the very black shadow
of the opaque B-ring, then the Cassini Division, and at the bottom, the shadow
of the A- ring. Image Note: Limb and shadow of Saturn's rings PICNO 1472S1-004
