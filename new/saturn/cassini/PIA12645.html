Atlas can be seen just above the center of this Cassini spacecraft image as
the moon orbits in the Roche Division between Saturn's A ring and thin F ring.

See [PIA08405](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08405) for closer
views of Atlas (30 kilometers, or 19 miles across). This view looks toward the
northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 12, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Atlas. Image scale is 13
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
