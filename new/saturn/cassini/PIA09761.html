With Enceladus nearly in front of the Sun from Cassini's viewpoint, its icy
jets become clearly visible against the background.

The view here is roughly perpendicular to the direction of the linear "tiger
stripe" fractures, or sulci, from which the jets emanate. The jets here
provide the extra glow at the bottom of the moon. The general brightness of
the sky around the moon is the diffuse glow of Saturn's E ring, which is an
end product of the jets' material being spread into a torus, or doughnut
shape, around Saturn.

North on Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is up and rotated 20
degrees to the left.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 30, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
187,000 kilometers (116,000 miles) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 157 degrees. Image scale is 1 kilometer (0.6
mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
