This mosaic of images from NASA's Cassini spacecraft depicts fan-like
structures in Saturn's tenuous F ring. Bright features are also visible near
the core of the ring. Such features suggest the existence of additional
objects in the F ring.

The bright, discontinuous features seen near the core of the F ring are clumps
of ring material that may be created by the passage of the ring's shepherding
moon Prometheus. They can be seen casting narrow shadows that extend toward
the bottom of the mosaic. The shadows are marked with arrows in the annotated
version. From right to left in the mosaic, the blades of the "fan" appear
darker than the surrounding material above the bright core of the F ring near
the larger, diagonal channels created by the ring's shepherding moon
Prometheus. The fans (marked "F" in the annotated version) can be seen as a
series of channels within the F ring's particles that appear to have a common
origin but that spread outward radially in different directions. Gravitational
perturbations on the ring material by a moonlet or clump of material can
create these fans. The moonlet or clump orbits more or less elliptically
compared to the rest of the F ring. It is probably embedded in the ring and is
causing the base of the fan channels to meet. See
[PIA12786](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12786) and
[PIA12785](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12785) for similar
observations of such fans.

The diagonal streamer-channels are periodically created by the gravity of the
potato-shaped moon Prometheus which is 148 kilometers (92 miles) on its
longest side but is on average 86 kilometers (53 miles) across. To learn more
and to watch a movie of this streamer-channel phenomenon, see PIA08397.

The images have been re-projected in this mosaic so that the F ring appears
straightened rather than curved and compressed azimuthally (along the ring).
This change represents a scale compression in the horizontal direction of
about 33 to one which is why Prometheus looks like a bright line. Prometheus
is marked "Pr" in the annotated version.

This sequence of 23 images was taken over about an hour. The earliest image is
on the right, and time progresses moving left in the mosaic. Each image was
re-projected and placed side by side in this montage. Scale in the original
images was about 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel. The images were contrast
enhanced and re-projected to a scale of 33 kilometers (21 miles) per pixel in
the mosaic's horizontal direction and one kilometer (0.6 miles) per pixel in
the mosaic's vertical direction. The single, cropped inset of the clumps
included here was then magnified by a factor of two.

The view in the original images looked toward the northern, unilluminated side
of the rings from about 54 degrees above the ring plane.

The images were taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on April 16, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 98 degrees.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
