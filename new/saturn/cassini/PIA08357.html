Cassini coasts beneath giant Saturn, staring upward at its gleaming crescent
and icy rings.

A great bull's-eye pattern is centered on the south pole, where a vast,
hurricane-like storm spins.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 26 degrees below
the ring plane. The view was acquired about two hours prior to
[PIA08347](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08347).

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural-color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 30, 2007, at a distance of approximately
1.1 million kilometers (700,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 61
kilometers (38 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
