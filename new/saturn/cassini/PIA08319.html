Daphnis drifts through the Keeler gap, at the center of its entourage of
waves.

The little moon (7 kilometers, or 4.3 miles across) draws material in the
Keeler gap (42 kilometers, or 26 miles wide) into these now familiar edge
waves as it orbits Saturn.

This view looks toward the lit side of the rings from about 25 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 27, 2006 at a distance of approximately 325,000 kilometers
(202,000 miles) from Daphnis and at a Sun-Daphnis-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 36 degrees. Image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
