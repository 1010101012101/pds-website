Saturn's rings cut across an eerie scene that is ruled by Titan's luminous
crescent and globe-encircling haze, broken by the small moon Enceladus, whose
icy jets are dimly visible at its south pole. North is up.

The scattered light around planet-sized Titan (5,150 kilometers, or 3,200
miles across) makes the moon's solid surface visible in silhouette. Enceladus
(505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) enjoys far clearer skies than its giant
sibling moon.

This view shows the unlit side of Saturn's rings.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on June 10, 2006 at a distance of approximately 3.9 million
kilometers (2.4 million miles) from Enceladus and 5.3 million kilometers (3.3
million miles) from Titan. The view was obtained at a Sun-moon-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of about 160 degrees relative to both moons. Image scale is 23
kilometers (15 miles) per pixel on Enceladus and 32 kilometers (20 miles) on
Titan.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
