The B ring, shown here, is filled with radial structure. This image of the
inner B ring was taken from the unlit side of the rings so the denser parts of
the ring transmit less light and consequently appear darker here.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Oct. 21, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.198 million
kilometers (745,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 26 degrees. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
