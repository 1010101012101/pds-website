NASA's Cassini spacecraft shows Saturn's shadow cutting sharply across its
rings as the orbits of ring particles carry them suddenly from day to night.
With no atmosphere to scatter light, shadows in space are much darker than
we're used to here on Earth.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 47
degrees below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 5, 2013.

The view was obtained at a distance of approximately 891,000 miles (1.434
million kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase,
angle of 85 degrees. Image scale is 51 miles (82 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
