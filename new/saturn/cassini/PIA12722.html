Clumps of ring material are revealed along the edge of Saturn's A ring in this
image taken during the planet's August 2009 equinox.

The granular appearance of the outer edge of the A ring, first discovered soon
after Cassini's orbit insertion, is likely created by gravitational clumping
of particles there. As ring particles round the planet in their orbits in this
particular region, they become perturbed by the gravitational forcing of
Saturn's two moons, Janus and Epimetheus, whose gravitational resonance at the
A ring's outer edge periodically forces the particles close together,
promoting clumping (see
[PIA09892](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09892)). The individual
clumps in this image are a few kilometers across, with the largest being about
10 kilometers (6 miles).

Similar clumping is seen at the outer edge of the B ring where a resonance
with Mimas has a similar effect on the ring particle orbits (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665) and
[PIA10421](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10421)).

This view looks toward the southern side of the rings from about 18 degrees
below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 11, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
190,000 kilometers (118,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 94 degrees. Image scale is 780 meters (2,560 feet) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
