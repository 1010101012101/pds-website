Broad, dark spokes in the B ring are clearly seen in this image of Saturn's
rings.

The spokes are finally becoming quite common, as they were during the Voyager
flybys. These observations and others like it seem to support the idea that
the spokes become most prominent near equinox.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Oct. 19, 2008 at a distance of approximately 1.011 million
kilometers (628,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or
phase, angle of 29 degrees. Image scale is 57 kilometers (35 miles) per pixel.

Also visible in this image is the moon Janus off beyond the rings.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
