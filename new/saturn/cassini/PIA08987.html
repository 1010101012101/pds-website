Incredible swirling details in Saturn's northern clouds can be seen in this
dazzling view. Shadows cast by the rings embrace the northern hemisphere.

The view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 16
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 10,
2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 939 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.3 million kilometers (800,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale
is 72 kilometers (45 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
