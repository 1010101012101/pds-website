Saturn's rings appear curved in this Cassini spacecraft view, which also shows
the moon Janus in the distance.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) is at the bottom of the image and
is farther from the spacecraft than the rings are. Near the top of the image
the rings appear curved because this view was captured using the narrow-angle
camera to show a portion of the rings off the ansa and because Cassini is very
near the ringplane.

This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of the rings from
about 4 degrees below the ringplane. Several background stars are visible.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on July 20, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Janus. Image scale is 13
kilometers (8 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
