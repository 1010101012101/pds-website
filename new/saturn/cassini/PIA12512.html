The Cassini spacecraft takes a look at Saturn's diffuse E ring which is formed
from icy material spewing out of the south pole of the moon Enceladus.

See [PIA08921](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08921) to learn
more about how Enceladus creates the E ring. The E ring is seen nearly edge-on
from slightly above the northern side of Saturn's ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Oct. 23, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.5 million kilometers (1.6 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 149
kilometers (92 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
