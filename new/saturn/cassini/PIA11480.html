Three moons have bunched themselves together in this image of Saturn's rings.

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) sits bright and overexposed
outside the faint F ring. Prometheus (86 kilometers, 53 miles across) lies
inside the F ring to the left of the center of the image. Tiny Daphnis (8
kilometers, or 5 miles across) is present but not visible in the thin Keeler
Gap of the A ring just below Prometheus in this image.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 20 degrees
below the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 2, 2009. The view was acquired at a
distance of approximately 1.1 million kilometers (684,000 miles) from Janus
and at a Sun-Janus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 47 degrees. Image scale is
63 kilometers (39 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
