The Cassini spacecraft peers through the fine, smoke-sized ice particles of
Saturn's F ring toward the cratered face of Mimas. The F ring's core, which
contains significantly larger particles, is dense enough to completely block
the light from Mimas.

The view looks toward the trailing hemisphere on the Saturn-facing side of
Mimas (397 kilometers, or 247 miles across), and toward the sunlit side of the
rings from about 2 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 18, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
772,000 kilometers (480,000 miles) from Mimas. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3
miles) per pixel on the moon.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
