Saturn's D ring may be faint and difficult to observe, but it rewards our
patience. In this image, the Cassini spacecraft has captured some of the
structure of the tenuous ring, appearing here as light/dark banding in the
upper-right of the image. (The brightest ring material, in the lower-left
here, is the C ring.) This banding, which is distinct from the vertical
warping pattern Cassini scientists are monitoring (see
[PIA08325](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08325)), remains
something of a mystery to scientists.

The vertical lines in this image are the tracks of stars. The D ring is so
faint that long exposures are required to capture it and during the imaging
the stars appear to move significantly due to the spacecraft's motion.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 8 degrees above
the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 2, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 317,000 miles (510,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 147
degrees. Image scale is 2 miles (3 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
