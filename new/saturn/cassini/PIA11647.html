Saturn's small moon Pan, brightly overexposed, casts a short shadow on the A
ring in this image taken before the planet's August 2009 equinox.

Pan (28 kilometers, or 17 miles across) orbits in the Encke Gap of the A ring
and can be seen near the center of the image. The novel illumination geometry
that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's angle to the ringplane,
significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-plane structures to look
anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings. These scenes are
possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which
occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after equinox, Cassini's
cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of Saturn's
moons (see [PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but
also the shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves
(see [PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the southern, sunlit side of the rings from about 58
degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on May 9, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
908,000 kilometers (564,000 miles) from Pan. Image scale is 5 kilometers (3
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
