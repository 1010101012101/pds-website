Cassini's prying infrared vision allows details of Saturn's storm-ridden
hydrogen atmosphere to be revealed as never before.

North of the dark south polar region is what may be a "polygonal wave"
structure developing in the atmosphere. Such a wave was seen in the northern
polar region in images from NASA's Voyager spacecraft and had a hexagon shape
that surrounded the pole.

This view has been magnified and enhanced to improve contrast in the visible
features. The image was taken using a compression scheme that decreases image
file size for storage onboard the spacecraft, and thus the image appears
slightly blocky, or "pixelated" following enhancement.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on July 31,
2005, through a filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light centered at
752 nanometers at a distance of approximately 1.4 million kilometers (900,000
miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 36
degrees. Resolution in the original image was 78 kilometers (48 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
