This fantastic close-up of Saturn's outer C ring shows large and sharp changes
in brightness across the rings, owing to the extreme variations in ring
particle concentrations at different distances from the planet. The dark gap
running through the center contains the Maxwell ringlet, as well as a faint,
narrow ringlet discovered in Cassini images. Another very dark region to the
right of the Maxwell gap is also a narrow gap.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on Oct. 29, 2004, at a distance of about 836,000 kilometers (519,000
miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 4.6 kilometers (2.9 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
