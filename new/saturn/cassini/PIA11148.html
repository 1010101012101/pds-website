This sequence of three images, obtained by NASA's Cassini spacecraft over the
course of about 10 minutes, shows the path of a newly found moonlet in a
bright arc of Saturn's faint G ring.

In each image, a small streak of light within the ring is visible. Unlike the
streaks in the background, which are distant stars smeared by the camera's
long exposure time of 46 seconds, this streak is aligned with the G ring and
moves along the ring as expected for an object embedded in the ring.

Cassini scientists interpret the moving streak to be reflected light from a
tiny moon half a kilometer (a third of mile) wide that is likely a major
source of material in the arc and the rest of the G ring. Debris knocked off
this moon forms a relatively bright arc of material near the inner edge of the
G ring, the most visible part of the ring in these images. That arc, in turn,
leaks material to form the entire ring.

These images were captured by Cassini's narrow-angle camera on Oct. 27, 2008\.
The first image (left) was taken in visible light, the second image (middle)
was taken in red light, and the third image (right) in near-infrared light
centered at a wavelength of 750 nanometers. Image scale for the first image is
7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel. The second and third images were taken at
reduced resolution. These spatially compressed images were captured at 14
kilometers (9 miles) per pixel and then displayed at a size equal to the first
image. This view looks toward the un-illuminated side of the rings from about
5 degrees above the ringplane. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.2 million kilometers (751,000 miles) from Saturn and at a sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 23 degrees.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
