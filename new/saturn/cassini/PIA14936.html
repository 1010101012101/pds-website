Dawn on Saturn is greeted across the vastness of interplanetary space by the
morning star, Venus, in this image from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. Venus
appears just off the edge of the planet, in the upper part of the image,
directly above the white streak of Saturn's G ring. Lower down, Saturn's E
ring makes an appearance, looking blue thanks to the scattering properties of
the dust that comprises the ring. A bright spot near the E ring is a distant
star.

Venus is, along with Mercury, Earth, and Mars, one of the rocky "terrestrial"
planets in the solar system that orbit relatively close to the sun. Though
Venus has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide that reaches nearly 900 degrees
Fahrenheit (500 degrees Celsius) and a surface pressure 100 times that of
Earth's, it is considered a twin to our planet because of their similar size,
mass, rocky composition and orbit. Venus is covered in thick sulfuric acid
clouds, making it very bright.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 21
degrees below the ring plane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft wide-angle camera on Jan. 4, 2013, at a distance of approximately
371,000 miles (597,000 kilometers) from Saturn. Image scale is 20 miles (32
kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
