Saturn's moon Enceladus reflects sunlight brightly while the planet and its
rings fill the background of this Cassini view.

Enceladus is one of the most reflective bodies in the solar system because it
is constantly coated by fresh, white ice particles. See
[PIA10500](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10500) and
[PIA05422](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA05422) to learn more.

This view looks toward the anti-Saturn side of Enceladus (504 kilometers, or
313 miles across). North on Enceladus is up and rotated 21 degrees to the
left.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Dec. 21, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
102,000 kilometers (63,000 miles) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 16 degrees. Image scale is 612 meters (2,008
feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
