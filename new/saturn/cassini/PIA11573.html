The shadow of the moon Janus dwarfs the shadow of Daphnis on Saturn's A ring
in this image taken as the planet approached its August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) orbits in the A ring's Keeler Gap
and, along with the moon's attending edge waves, can be seen casting a short
shadow in the top left quadrant of the image. Equinox has exposed shadows cast
by these edge waves, or vertical structures of ring material created by
Daphnis' gravity (see
[PIA11655](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11655)).

Janus (179 kilometers, or 111 miles across) is not pictured here, but the
moon's shadow stretches across the A ring from the center of the image to near
the Encke Gap on the left of the image. The Cassini Division appears bright on
the right of the image.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows out-of-plane structures and moons orbiting in or near the
plane of Saturn's equatorial rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These
scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. To learn more about
this special time and to see movies of moons' shadows moving across the rings,
see [PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 27
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on July 11, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
491,000 kilometers (305,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 26 degrees. Image scale is 26 kilometers (16 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
