Mimas orbits beyond the outer fringes of Saturn's main rings, perturbing the
orbits of ring particles and creating gaps like the Huygens Gap within the
Cassini Division (the wide, dark gap near lower left). The outer edge of the B
ring (lower left corner) and the thin, outermost section of the A ring appear
notably brighter than the bulk of the A ring, suggesting differences in ring
particle density or composition. Small knots in the thin F ring are visible at
lower right. Mimas is 398 kilometers (247 miles) across.

This view is from Cassini's vantage point beneath the ring plane. The image
was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow angle
camera on Nov. 18, 2004, at a distance of approximately 4.7 million kilometers
(2.9 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 27 kilometers (17 miles)
per pixel. Contrast was enhanced to aid visibility.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
