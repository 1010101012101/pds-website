The Cassini spacecraft catches Saturn's moon Daphnis making waves and casting
shadows from the narrow Keeler Gap of the planet's A ring in this view taken
around the time of Saturn's August 2009 equinox.

Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) is almost invisible in this view,
but the shadows cast on the wide A ring can be seen below the center of the
image. The Enke Gap of the A ring, which is wider than the Keeler Gap, is on
the right. Saturn's thin F ring is on the left of the view. See
[PIA11629](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11629) for a similar,
closer view.

More than a dozen background stars are visible in this image.

Daphnis has an inclined orbit and its gravitational pull perturbs the orbits
of the particles of the A ring forming the Keeler Gap's edge and sculpts the
edge into waves having both horizontal (radial) and out-of-plane components.
Material on the inner edge of the gap orbits faster than the moon so that the
waves there lead the moon in its orbit. Material on the outer edge moves
slower than the moon, so waves there trail the moon. See
[PIA11656](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11656) to learn more
about this process.

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 13
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 16, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 108 degrees. Image scale is 12 kilometers (8
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
