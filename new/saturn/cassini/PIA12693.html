As Enceladus spews water ice from its south polar region, Cassini also shows
Saturn's faint G ring before the moon.

See [PIA11688](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11688) and
[PIA08321](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08321) to learn more
about this active moon and how it creates Saturn's E ring. The E ring is too
diffuse to be seen here, but the G ring can just barely be seen in this image.
The G ring is actually closer to Cassini here even though the ring appears to
be behind Enceladus. The most brightly lit terrain seen on the moon here (on
the left of the moon) is illuminated by the sun and is on the leading
hemisphere of Enceladus (504 kilometers, 313 miles across). Light reflected
off Saturn covers a larger area on the Saturn-facing side of the moon on the
right.

North on Enceladus is up. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of
the rings from just above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 26, 2010. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
993,000 kilometers (617,000 miles) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 162 degrees. Image scale is 6 kilometers (4
miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
