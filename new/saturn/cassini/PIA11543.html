The moon Pandora casts a shadow onto Saturn's A ring but not the F ring.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) can be seen at the bottom of the
image. Because Pandora is on an inclined orbit, its shadow can fall on the
main rings, but entirely miss the F ring.

The novel illumination geometry created as Saturn approaches its August 2009
equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies
of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 53
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on June 1, 2009. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Pandora and at a Sun-Pandora-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 98 degrees. Image
scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
