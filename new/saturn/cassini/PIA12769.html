Two moons, Rhea and Dione, join the planet and its rings in this view from the
Cassini spacecraft. Rhea and Dione are respectively the second and third
largest moons of Saturn, but they are tiny compared to the planet.

Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is near the center of the image.
Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) is on the right. The shadow cast
by a third moon, Tethys, is also visible near the bottom of the image, south
of the shadows cast by the planet's rings and near the terminator between
light and dark. Tethys is not shown here. Part of the large storm that has
been churning through the northern atmosphere for months can be seen in the
top left of the image.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on March 11,
2011 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 752 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 94 degrees. Image scale is 172
kilometers (107 miles) per pixel on Saturn.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
