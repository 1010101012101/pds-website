Prometheus shines brightly in this image, taken as part of the ongoing
campaign to precisely determine the orbits of Saturn's small moons.

Moons are usually quite bright in this type of observation, due to the long
exposure times employed. Long exposures are required in order to gather enough
light so that dim, 12th (or even 13th or 14th) magnitude stars are visible in
the background, making it possible to determine where the Cassini spacecraft
is pointed on the sky with great accuracy. Imaging scientists are then able to
precisely determine the position of the moon's center, thus refining their
understanding of the moon's orbit and any changes to it over time due to
perturbations by other moons.

Two stars can be seen in this view: one to the right of Prometheus and one
near lower left.

Exterior to Prometheus (102 kilometers, or 63 miles across) is the F ring,
with its inner and outer flanking ringlets and a streamer channel created by
the moon. The outer A ring is seen at top.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 21
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan. 22, 2008. The view was obtained
at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers (1.1 million miles) from
Prometheus and at a Sun-Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 34 degrees.
Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
