The Cassini spacecraft looks toward the south pole of Enceladus, with a
glimpse of Saturns rings in the distance, during the spacecrafts close flyby
Nov. 2, 2009.

See [PIA08386](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08386) to learn
more about the active south pole of Enceladus. This view looks toward the
anti-Saturn side of Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across). The rings
have been brightened relative to Enceladus to increase visibility.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Nov. 2, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
10,400 kilometers (6,500 miles) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-
spacecraft, or phase, angle of 6 degrees. Image scale is 630 meters (2,100
feet) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
