The Cassini spacecraft looked toward the darkened night side of Saturn to
capture the eerie glow of the rings, which, not being blocked by the planet's
bulk, remained brilliant in full sunlight.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Dec. 24, 2005, at a distance of approximately 286,000 kilometers
(178,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
