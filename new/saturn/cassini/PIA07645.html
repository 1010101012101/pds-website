This fanciful view spies the Saturnian moons, Dione and Enceladus, from just
beneath the ringplane. Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314 miles across) is on
the near side of the rings with respect to Cassini, and Dione (1,126
kilometers, or 700 miles across) is on the far side.

Saturn's shadow stretches beyond the outermost reaches of the main rings,
causing them to disappear at left.

The image was taken with the Cassini narrow-angle camera using spectral
filters sensitive to polarized green light on Oct. 15, 2005 at a distance of
approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3 million miles) from Dione and 1.5
million kilometers (900,000 miles) from Enceladus. The image scale is 12
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel on Dione and 9 kilometers (6 miles) per pixel
on Enceladus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
