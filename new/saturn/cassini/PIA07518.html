Three very different worlds crowd the frame in this unique view from the
Cassini spacecraft, which although partly overexposed, provides a splendid
look at several major targets of interest for the mission.

Titan (at the top) has a thick, hazy atmosphere. Cassini has observed it to be
a world where complex geological and atmospheric processes are occurring. At
5,150 kilometers (3,200 miles) across, it is Saturn's largest moon, and is the
second largest moon in the solar system, after Jupiter's moon Ganymede (5,262
kilometers, or 3,270 miles across).

Tethys (at the bottom) has been battered by impacts over the eons, and some of
its many craters are visible in this image. Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665
miles across) is one of Saturn's major icy moons, having a density close to
that of water. This moon shows evidence that icy tectonic processes have
occurred on its frozen surface, such as the immense canyon system called
Ithaca Chasma.

Epimetheus (center) is one of Saturn's "ring moons": small, porous bodies that
orbit within or just beyond the rings. Cassini acquired the closest-ever view
of cratered Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles across) in March, 2005.

Also near center are Saturn's F ring and the outer edge of the A ring to the
left. In addition to the F ring's usually bright core, several other ringlets
are resolved here, giving the ring a soft, wispy character that shows contrast
with the more sharply defined A ring.

Appearances can be deceiving in two dimensional images like this one where it
is difficult to tell which objects are in the foreground and which are farther
away. In this scene, Tethys is the closest object to Cassini, at 1.2 million
kilometers (700,000 miles) away. Epimetheus is on the near side of the rings
and is 1.4 million kilometers (900,000 miles) distant. The giant moon Titan is
2.7 million kilometers (1.7 million miles) away, more than twice as far from
Cassini as Tethys.

This view is a mosaic of two images taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Feb. 19, 2005. The image scale in the scene
ranges from 16 kilometers (10 miles) per pixel on Titan to 7 kilometers (4
miles) per pixel on Tethys.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
