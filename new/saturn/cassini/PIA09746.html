Saturn's narrow F ring displays a bright, double-stranded core, flanked by
fainter material. The continuing evolution of this quirky ring is an ongoing
subject of study for Cassini scientists.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Sept. 7, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 3.1 million kilometers (1.9 million miles) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 29 degrees. Image scale is 18
kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
