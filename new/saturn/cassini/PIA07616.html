The outer reaches of Saturn's Cassini Division merges with the inner A ring
(at the right) in a region that is rich in structure. For context, other
Cassini views of this region are available (see
[PIA07512](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07512)).

The smooth region leading up to the A ring grows brighter from the left to the
right (known as a "ramp" to ring scientists). This region contains a faint
"double-wave" structure that is a density feature caused by the influence of
the co-orbital moons Janus and Epimetheus. Scientists are interested in
observing the evolution of this density wave as the moons swap places in their
orbits every few years, presumably resulting in a change in the perturbations
that cause this feature.

This image was taken in visible light with the Cassini narrow-angle camera on
Sept. 5, 2005, at a distance of approximately 441,000 kilometers (274,000
miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 2 kilometers (1 mile) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
