This artist's concept illustrates how charged water particles flow into the
Saturnian atmosphere from the planet's rings, causing a reduction in
atmospheric brightness. The observations were made with the W.M. Keck
Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, with NASA funding. The analysis was led by
the University of Leicester, England.

Keck observing time was funded by NASA, with a letter of support from the
Cassini mission to Saturn. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative
project of NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Italian Space Agency. The
mission is managed by JPL for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington.
JPL is a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena,
Calif.
