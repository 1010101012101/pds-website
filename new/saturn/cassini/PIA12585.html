The Cassini spacecraft images dark spokes on Saturn's B ring.

Spokes are radial markings on Saturn's rings that continue to interest
scientists, and they can be seen here stretching left to right across the
image. Spokes appear bright when they are viewed at phase, or Sun-Saturn-
spacecraft, angles higher than about 45 degrees. However, this image was taken
at a phase angle of 20 degrees, which is why the spokes appear dark. See
[PIA11144](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11144) and
[PIA08288](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08288) to learn more.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from about 5
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible red light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-
angle camera on Jan. 27, 2010. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 260,000 kilometers (162,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is
18 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
