Saturn's fourth-largest moon, Dione, can be seen through the haze of the
planet's largest moon, Titan, in this view of the two posing before the planet
and its rings from NASA's Cassini spacecraft.

The north polar hood can be seen on Titan appearing as a detached layer at the
top of the moon here. See
[PIA08137](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08137) and
[PIA09739](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09739) to learn more
about Titan's atmosphere and the north polar hood.

See [PIA10560](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10560) and
[PIA07638](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07638) to learn more
about and see a closer view of the wisps on Dione's trailing hemisphere, which
appear as bright streaks here.

This view looks toward the sides of Titan (3,200 miles or 5,150 kilometers
across) and Dione (698 miles or 1,123 kilometers across) facing away from
Saturn. North is up on the moons. This view looks toward the northern, sunlit
side of the rings from just above the ring plane.

Images taken using red, green and blue spectral filters were combined to
create this natural color view. The images were obtained with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on May 21, 2011, at a distance of approximately
1.4 million miles (2.3 million kilometers) from Titan and 2 million miles (3.2
million kilometers) from Dione. Image scale is 9 miles (14 kilometers) per
pixel on Titan and 12 miles (19 kilometers) on Dione.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
