The Cassini spacecraft captures signs of activity on both sides of the Roche
Division-- the region between Saturn's A and F rings.

At right, the small moon Daphnis (8 kilometers, or 5 miles across) makes waves
in the edges of the narrow Keeler Gap. At left are several minor kinks in the
narrow core of the F ring.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 18
degrees above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the
Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Aug. 31, 2008. The view was acquired
at a distance of approximately 1.2 million kilometers (735,000 miles) from
Saturn. Image scale is 7 kilometers (4 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
