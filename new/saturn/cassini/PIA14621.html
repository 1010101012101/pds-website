The Cassini spacecraft looks past Saturn's main rings to spy the tiny moon
Atlas, which orbits between the main rings and the thin F ring.

The main rings are closer to the spacecraft than Atlas is, and the moon
appears as only a small, white dot in the center of the image. This view looks
toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane.
See [PIA08906](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08906) and
[PIA08405](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08405) for other views
of Atlas (19 miles, 30 kilometers across).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on April 16, 2012. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
870,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) from Atlas. Image scale is 5 miles (8
kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
