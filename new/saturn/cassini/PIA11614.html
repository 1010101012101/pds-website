Saturn's moon Prometheus casts a shadow on the narrow F ring in this image
captured weeks after the planet's August 2009 equinox.

The gravity of potato-shaped Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles across)
periodically creates streamer-channels in the F ring, and the moon's handiwork
can be seen to the right of the shadow. To learn more and to watch a movie of
this process, see
[PIA08397](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08397).

The novel illumination geometry that accompanies equinox lowers the sun's
angle to the ringplane, significantly darkens the rings, and causes out-of-
plane structures to look anomalously bright and cast shadows across the rings.
These scenes are possible only during the few months before and after Saturn's
equinox, which occurs only once in about 15 Earth years. Before and after
equinox, Cassini's cameras have spotted not only the predictable shadows of
some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11665](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11665)).

This view looks toward the sunlit, northern side of the rings from about 11
degrees above the ringplane. Prometheus was overexposed in this image and has
been dimmed by a factor of three.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Sept. 23, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
2 million kilometers (1.2 million miles) from Prometheus and at a Sun-
Prometheus-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 74 degrees. Image scale is 12
kilometers (7 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
