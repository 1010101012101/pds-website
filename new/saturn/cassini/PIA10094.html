Like Earth, Saturn has an invisible ring of energetic ions trapped in its
magnetic field. This feature is known as a "ring current." This ring current
has been imaged with a special camera on Cassini sensitive to energetic
neutral atoms.

This is a false color map of the intensity of the energetic neutral atoms
emitted from the ring current through a processed called charged exchange. In
this process a trapped energetic ion steals and electron from cold gas atoms
and becomes neutral and escapes the magnetic field.

The Cassini Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument's ion and neutral camera records
the intensity of the escaping particles, which provides a map of the ring
current. In this image, the colors represent the intensity of the neutral
emission, which is a reflection of the trapped ions. This "ring" is much
farther from Saturn (roughly five times farther) than Saturn's famous icy
rings. Red in the image represents the higher intensity of the particles,
while blue is less intense.

Saturn's ring current had not been mapped before on a global scale, only
"snippets" or areas were mapped previously but not in this detail. This
instrument allows scientists to produce movies (see
[PIA10083](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA10083)) that show how
this ring changes over time. These movies reveal a dynamic system, which is
usually not as uniform as depicted in this image. The ring current is doughnut
shaped but in some instances it appears as if someone took a bite out of it.

This image was obtained on March 19, 2007, at a latitude of about 54.5 degrees
and radial distance 1.5 million kilometres (920,000 miles). Saturn is at the
center, and the dotted circles represent the orbits of the moon's Rhea and
Titan. The Z axis points parallel to Saturn's spin axis, the X axis points
roughly sunward in the sun-spin axis plane, and the Y axis completes the
system, pointing roughly toward dusk. The ion and neutral camera's field of
view is marked by the white line and accounts for the cut-off of the image on
the left. The image is an average of the activity over a (roughly) 3-hour
period.
