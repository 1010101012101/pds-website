Joining other moons in heralding the coming of Saturn's August 2009 equinox,
the moon Tethys casts its shadow across Saturn's F ring and part of the A
ring.

The penumbra, or outer non-opaque part of Tethys' shadow, has intersected the
A ring. Only around the time of equinox are the shadows of the moons cast onto
Saturn's rings. For an animation of the moon Epimetheus casting a shadow on
the A ring, see [ PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/
PIA11651).

The image on the left was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft
wide-angle camera on March 20, 2009. The image on the right was taken with the
narrow-angle camera at nearly the same time. Tethys itself is not visible in
these images, but the small moon Prometheus (86 kilometers, or 53 miles
across) can be seen between the F and A rings in the top of the wide-angle
camera image.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 37
degrees above the ringplane. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 880,000 kilometers (547,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 124 degrees. Image scale is 49
kilometers (31 miles) per pixel in the wide-angle image. In the narrow-angle
camera image, the scale is 5 kilometers (3 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
