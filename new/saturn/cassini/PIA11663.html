Cassini spies a shadow cast by a vertically extended structure or object in
the F ring in this image taken as Saturn approaches its August 2009 equinox.

The structure can be seen as a bulge near the bright core of the ring on the
right of the image. Imaging scientists are working to understand the origin of
structures such as this one, but they think this image shows the shadow of
what appears to be a vertically extended object in the core of the F ring.

The second (bottom) version of the image has been brightened to enhance the
visibility of the ring and shadow. Background stars appear elongated in the
image because of the camera's exposure time.

This image and others like it (see
[PIA11662](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11662)) are only
possible around the time of Saturn's equinox which occurs every half-Saturn-
year (equivalent to about 15 Earth years). The illumination geometry that
accompanies equinox lowers the sun's angle to the ring plane and causes out-
of-plane structures to cast long shadows across the rings. Cassini's cameras
have spotted not only the predictable shadows of some of Saturn's moons (see
[PIA11657](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11657)), but also the
shadows of newly revealed vertical structures in the rings themselves (see
[PIA11654](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11654)).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 54 degrees
below the ring plane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 9, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
592,000 kilometers (368,000 miles) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft,
or phase, angle of 97 degrees. Image scale is 3 kilometers (2 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
