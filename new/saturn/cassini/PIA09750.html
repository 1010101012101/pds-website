Having recently rounded the ansa, or outer edge of the rings, Mimas heads off
toward right. This view from the Cassini spacecraft provides a crisp look at
the fine material and detailed structure in the Cassini Division that is not
readily visible from the Earth. The faint F ring, just visible between Mimas
and the A ring, bounds the main rings of Saturn.

Mimas is 397 kilometers (247 miles) across.

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 4 degrees below
the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible green light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-
angle camera on Sept. 7, 2007. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 2.9 million kilometers (1.8 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 18 kilometers (11 miles) per pixel on Mimas.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
