The Cassini spacecraft has been monitoring propeller features since their
discovery. Here the propeller dubbed Bleriot is seen in a recent image. The
bright dash-like features are regions where a small moonlet has caused ring
particles to cluster together more densely than normal. Beyond the bright
areas are fainter, longer dark linear features. These are believed to be
extended regions where the same moonlet has caused particles to evacuate,
leaving an under-dense (thus darker) area.

To learn more about propellers, see
[PIA07792](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07792) and
[PIA07791](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA07791). For more of
Bleriot, see [PIA12789](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA12789).

This view looks toward the sunlit side of the rings from about 33 degrees
above the ringplane. The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini
spacecraft narrow-angle camera on April 3, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 301,000 miles (484,000
kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 119
degrees. Image scale is 2 miles (3 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
