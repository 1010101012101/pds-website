Two of Saturn's small moons can be seen orbiting beyond the planet's thin F
ring in this Cassini spacecraft image.

Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles across) is on the left, and Epimetheus
(113 kilometers, or 70 miles across) is on the right. This view looks toward
the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above the ringplane. Both
moons are closer to Cassini than are the rings. Pandora is slightly closer to
Cassini than Epimetheus here.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Nov. 23, 2009. The view was acquired at a distance of approximately
1.3 million kilometers (808,000 miles) from Pandora and Epimetheus. Image
scale is 8 kilometers (5 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
