Enceladus's unusual plume is only easily visible when the Cassini spacecraft
and the Sun are on opposite sides of Enceladus. So what's lighting up the moon
then? It's light reflected off Saturn. This lighting trick allows the Cassini
spacecraft to capture both the back-lit plume and the surface of Enceladus in
one shot.

This view looks toward the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Enceladus. North on
Enceladus is up. The image was taken in blue light with the Cassini spacecraft
narrow-angle camera on April 2, 2013.

The view was acquired at a distance of approximately 517,000 miles (832,000
kilometers) from Enceladus and at a Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle
of 175 degrees. Image scale is 3 miles (5 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
