With the Sun directly behind Cassini, the spacecraft spies the opposition
surge in Saturn's inner A ring. The opposition effect becomes visible from
this special viewing geometry. See
[PIA08247](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08247) for a detailed
description of the effect.

This view looks toward the rings from about 11 degrees below the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Dec. 2, 2006 at a distance of approximately 287,000 kilometers
(178,000 miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 17 kilometers (11 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
