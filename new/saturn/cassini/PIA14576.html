The Cassini spacecraft watches as the shadows of Saturn's rings grow wider and
creep farther south as the seasons progress from the planet's August 2009
equinox.

See [PIA11667](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11667) to learn
more about the changing seasons and to see a view from equinox when the rings
cast only a thin shadow on Saturn's equator. See
[PIA09793](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA09793) for an even
earlier view of the rings' wide shadows draped high on the northern
hemisphere.

This view looks toward the northern, sunlit side of the rings from just above
the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on Aug. 22,
2011 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared light
centered at 939 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 252,000 miles (405,000 kilometers) from Saturn and at a Sun-
Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 140 degrees. Image scale is 13 miles (21
kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
