This image is a false-color ultraviolet view of Saturn's B ring (center) and A
ring (right), separated by a large gap known as the Cassini Division. It shows
a bright horizontal streak, created by a series of time lapse images involving
a star named 26 Taurus.

The image was made over a nine-hour period as the star drifted behind the
rings. The opacity of the outer A ring is most pronounced on its inner edge,
indicating more ring debris is present there. The Encke Gap, much smaller than
the Cassini Division, is visible near the outer edge of the A ring. The B ring
is significantly more opaque than the A ring, indicating a greater density of
ring material when imaged from above. The sky behind the rings glows red in
the ultraviolet wavelengths from the hydrogen gas that fills the solar system.

The images were processed from data taken by the ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph aboard the Cassini spacecraft in May 2005.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph was built at, and the team is based at the University of
Colorado, Boulder.
