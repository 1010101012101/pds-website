Just before Saturn's August 2009 equinox, Dione joined other Saturnian moons
in casting shadows on the planet's main rings.

Dione (1,123 kilometers, or 698 miles across) is not pictured, but that moon
casts a long, faintly discernible shadow on the F and A rings on the left of
the image. Enceladus (504 kilometers, or 313 miles across) is near the center
top of the image. Tethys (1062 kilometers, or 660 miles across) is on the
lower right of the image. The small moon Pandora (81 kilometers, or 50 miles
across) can also be detected just outside the F ring near the middle of the
image. Faint background stars also are visible.

The novel illumination geometry created around the time of Saturn's August
2009 equinox allows moons orbiting in or near the plane of Saturn's equatorial
rings to cast shadows onto the rings. These scenes are possible only during
the few months before and after Saturn's equinox, which occurs only once in
about 15 Earth years. To learn more about this special time and to see movies
of moons' shadows moving across the rings, see
[PIA11651](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11651) and
[PIA11660](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA11660).

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 16
degrees above the ringplane. The rings have been brightened to enhance
visibility.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Aug. 5, 2009. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 125
kilometers (78 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
