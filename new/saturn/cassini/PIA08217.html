Enceladus blasts its icy spray into space in this unlit-side ring view that
also features a tiny sliver of Rhea.

The south polar region of Rhea (1,528 kilometers, or 949 miles across) peeks
out from beneath the rings to the right of Enceladus (505 kilometers, or 314
miles across).

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on June 9, 2006 at a distance of approximately 3.9 million kilometers
(2.4 million miles) from Enceladus and 4.6 million kilometers (2.9 million
miles) from Rhea. The Sun-Enceladus-spacecraft, or phase, angle is 161
degrees. Image scale is 23 kilometers (14 miles) per pixel on Enceladus.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
