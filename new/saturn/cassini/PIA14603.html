The shadow of the moon Mimas creates a smudge on the southern hemisphere of
Saturn in this view from the Cassini spacecraft.

Mimas does not appear here, but it does cast its shadow on the planet in the
lower left of the image. The shadows cast by the rings dominate the upper
right of the image. This view looks toward the southern, unilluminated side of
the rings from about 1 degree below the ringplane.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle camera on Jan.
21, 2012 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of near-infrared
light centered at 750 nanometers. The view was acquired at a distance of
approximately 1.6 million miles (2.6 million kilometers) from Saturn and at a
Sun-Saturn-spacecraft, or phase, angle of 70 degrees. Image scale is 9 miles
(15 kilometers) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
