The left image is a false-color view of Saturn's A ring from the ultraviolet
imaging spectrograph instrument aboard the Cassini spacecraft.

The ring is the bluest in the center, where the gravitational clumps are the
largest. The thickest black band in the ring is the Enke Gap, and the thin
black band further to the right is the Keeler Gap.

The right image is a computer simulation about 150 meters (490 feet) across
illustrating a clumpy region of particles in the A ring. The particles are
moving counterclockwise, from bottom to top.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter was designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The ultraviolet imaging
spectrograph was built at, and the team is based at the University of
Colorado, Boulder.
