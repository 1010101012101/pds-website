Saturn's G ring glows like a neon garland in this lovely narrow angle camera
image from Cassini. The comparison between the diffuse outer boundary and the
sharp inner edge of this ring, which consists of fine, dust-sized icy
particles, is particularly noteworthy. Close Cassini views such as this should
provide ring scientists with clues about how this ring is produced and
confined.

The G ring extends from 166,000 to 173,200 kilometers (103,100 to 107,600
miles) from Saturn's center. (Saturn is 120,500 kilometers [74,900 miles] wide
at its equator.)

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini narrow-angle camera on
Oct. 24, 2005, at a distance of approximately 2.1 million kilometers (1.3
million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 12 kilometers (8 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
