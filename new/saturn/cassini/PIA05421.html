Nine days before it entered orbit, Cassini spacecraft captured this exquisite
natural color view of Saturn's rings. The images that make up this composition
were obtained from Cassini's vantage point beneath the ring plane with the
narrow angle camera on June 21, 2004, at a distance of 6.4 million kilometers
(4 million miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 38 kilometers (23 miles) per
pixel.

The brightest part of the rings, curving from the upper right to the lower
left in the image, is the B ring. Many bands throughout the B ring have a
pronounced sandy color. Other color variations across the rings can be seen.
Color variations in Saturn's rings have previously been seen in Voyager and
Hubble Space Telescope images. Cassini's images show that color variations in
the rings are more pronounced in this viewing geometry than they are when seen
from Earth.

Saturn's rings are made primarily of water ice. Since pure water ice is white,
it is believed that different colors in the rings reflect different amounts of
contamination by other materials such as rock or carbon compounds. In
conjunction with information from other Cassini instruments, Cassini images
will help scientists determine the composition of different parts of Saturn's
ring system.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
Cassini-Huygens mission for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C.
The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras, were designed, developed and
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute,
Boulder, Colo.
