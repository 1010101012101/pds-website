The Cassini spacecraft captures a gathering of three moons near the rings'
outer edge as the icy worlds dutifully march about Saturn.

Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) hangs in front of Rhea (1,528
kilometers, or 949 miles across) near left. Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52
miles across) skirts the outer edge of the F ring below center.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from less than a
degree above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Aug. 2, 2007. The view was obtained at a distance of approximately
3.7 million kilometers (2.3 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is about
22 kilometers (14 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
