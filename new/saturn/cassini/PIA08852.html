This ringscape shows the outermost part of the rings' spoke-forming region,
the other edge of the B ring, and the regular bands of material within the
Cassini Division. Spokes are only seen in Saturn's B ring, interior to the
Cassini Division.

Several very faint spokes are visible at left, above center. Also on the left
half of the image are variations in brightness along the direction of particle
motion, a commonly seen feature in the spoke-forming region.

The Cassini Division is the region to the right of the brightest ringlet in
the image. This view looks toward the unlit side of the rings from about 20
degrees above the ringplane.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft narrow-angle
camera on Dec. 9, 2006 at a distance of approximately 1.7 million kilometers
(1.1 million miles) from Saturn. Image scale is 10 kilometers (6 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
