Across the darkened expanse of Saturn's rings, the Cassini spacecraft spies
one of the F-ring shepherd moons.

Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across) orbits Saturn just beyond the
outer edges of the F ring. Close to the planet, the image of the rings is
slightly distorted by Saturn's upper atmosphere.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane. At lower right, ring shadows are cast upon the
planet.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
