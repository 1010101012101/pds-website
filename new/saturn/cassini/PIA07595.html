Squinting at this view of Saturn's rings reveals not one but two of the four
narrow ringlets in the Encke Gap (325 kilometers, or 200 miles, wide). The
innermost of the two ringlets is much brighter and full of clumps.

The complicated and dynamic features in the Encke Gap are extensively
influenced by the presence of Pan (26 kilometers, or 16 miles, across), which
orbits in the center of the gap. The Encke Gap may contain other small
moonlets, which imaging team members hope to discover in the future.

The image was taken in visible light with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle
camera on Aug. 20, 2005, at a distance of approximately 273,000 kilometers
(170,000 miles) from Saturn. The image scale is 13 kilometers (8 miles) per
pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
