Graceful giant Saturn poses with a few of the small worlds it holds close.
From this viewpoint the Cassini spacecraft can see across the entirety of the
planet's shadow on the rings, to where the ringplane emerges once again into
sunlight.

Tethys (1,071 kilometers, or 665 miles across) shines large and bright near
the bottom of the scene. Pandora (84 kilometers, or 52 miles across) sits
outside the F ring, below center. Epimetheus (116 kilometers, or 72 miles
across) is a speck on the far side of the ringplane, immediately to the right
of Saturn's limb. Most of the other bright specks near the rings are
background stars.

This view looks toward the unilluminated side of the rings from about 8
degrees above the ringplane. The image has been brightened to enhance the
appearance of the small moons.

The image was taken with the Cassini spacecraft wide-angle camera on June 2,
2007 using a spectral filter sensitive to wavelengths of infrared light
centered at 918 nanometers. The view was obtained at a distance of
approximately 2.2 million kilometers (1.4 million miles) from Saturn. Image
scale is 131 kilometers (81 miles) per pixel.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in
Boulder, Colo.
