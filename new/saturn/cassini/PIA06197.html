A large, bright and complex convective storm that appeared in Saturn's
southern hemisphere in mid-September 2004 was the key in solving a long-
standing mystery about the ringed planet.

Saturn's atmosphere and its rings are shown here in a false color composite
made from Cassini images taken in near infrared light through filters that
sense different amounts of methane gas. Portions of the atmosphere with a
large abundance of methane above the clouds are red, indicating clouds that
are deep in the atmosphere. Grey indicates high clouds, and brown indicates
clouds at intermediate altitudes. The rings are bright blue because there is
no methane gas between the ring particles and the camera.

The complex feature with arms and secondary extensions just above and to the
right of center is called the Dragon Storm. It lies in a region of the
southern hemisphere referred to as "storm alley" by imaging scientists because
of the high level of storm activity observed there by Cassini in the last
year.

The Dragon Storm was a powerful source of radio emissions during July and
September of 2004. The radio waves from the storm resemble the short bursts of
static generated by lightning on Earth. Cassini detected the bursts only when
the storm was rising over the horizon on the night side of the planet as seen
from the spacecraft; the bursts stopped when the storm moved into sunlight.
This on/off pattern repeated for many Saturn rotations over a period of
several weeks, and it was the clock-like repeatability that indicated the
storm and the radio bursts are related. Scientists have concluded that the
Dragon Storm is a giant thunderstorm whose precipitation generates electricity
as it does on Earth. The storm may be deriving its energy from Saturn's deep
atmosphere.

One mystery is why the radio bursts start while the Dragon Storm is below the
horizon on the night side and end when the storm is on the day side, still in
full view of the Cassini spacecraft. A possible explanation is that the
lightning source lies to the east of the visible cloud, perhaps because it is
deeper where the currents are eastward relative to those at cloud top levels.
If this were the case, the lightning source would come up over the night side
horizon and would sink down below the day side horizon before the visible
cloud. This would explain the timing of the visible storm relative to the
radio bursts.

The Dragon Storm is of great interest for another reason. In examining images
taken of Saturn's atmosphere over many months, imaging scientists found that
the Dragon Storm arose in the same part of Saturn's atmosphere that had
earlier produced large bright convective storms. In other words, the Dragon
Storm appears to be a long-lived storm deep in the atmosphere that
periodically flares up to produce dramatic bright white plumes which subside
over time. One earlier sighting, in July 2004, was also associated with strong
radio bursts. And another, observed in March 2004 and captured in a movie
created from images of the atmosphere
([PIA06082](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06082) and
[PIA06083](http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA06083)) spawned three
little dark oval storms that broke off from the arms of the main storm. Two of
these subsequently merged with each other; the current to the north carried
the third one off to the west, and Cassini lost track of it. Small dark storms
like these generally get stretched out until they merge with the opposing
currents to the north and south.

These little storms are the food that sustains the larger atmospheric
features, including the larger ovals and the eastward and westward currents.
If the little storms come from the giant thunderstorms, then together they
form a food chain that harvests the energy of the deep atmosphere and helps
maintain the powerful currents.

Cassini has many more chances to observe future flare-ups of the Dragon Storm,
and others like it over the course of the mission. It is likely that
scientists will come to solve the mystery of the radio bursts and observe
storm creation and merging in the next 2 or 3 years.

The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a
division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages the
mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini
orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at
JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colo.
