<h3>Caption:</h3>

<p>
 The left-hand image is a Dawn FC (framing camera) image, which shows the apparent brightness of Vesta's surface. The right-hand image is based on this apparent brightness image, which has had a color-coded height representation of the topography overlain onto it. The topography is calculated from a set of images that were observed from different viewing directions, which allows stereo reconstruction. The various colors correspond to the height of the area. The white and red areas in the topography image are the highest areas and the blue areas are the lowest areas. Licinia is the large, bowl shaped crater in the center of the image. In the topography image, the colored topography contours, which are evenly spaced around the interior of the crater, highlight the bowl-shape of Licinia. Licinia has a sharp rim, which has a scalloped edge. This scalloped shape was probably formed by material falling into the center of the crater at different rates. In the apparent brightness image, linear streaks on the crater walls are evidence for mass movement of material into the center of the crater. This material pilling up in the center of the crater may have formed the hills of material in this area. There is also smoother material in the center of the crater, which is slightly darker than the surrounding material. There is some bright material around the rim of the crater.

<p>
 These images are located in Vesta's Floronia quadrangle, in Vesta's northern hemisphere. NASA's Dawn spacecraft obtained the apparent brightness image with its framing camera on Oct. 11, 2011. This image was taken through the camera's clear filter. The distance to the surface of Vesta is 700 kilometers (435 miles) and the image has a resolution of about 70 meters (230 feet) per pixel. This image was acquired during the HAMO (high-altitude mapping orbit) phase of the mission. These images are lambert-azimuthal map projected.

<h3>Background Info:</h3>

<p>
 The Dawn mission to Vesta and Ceres is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington D.C. UCLA is responsible for overall Dawn mission science. The Dawn framing cameras have been developed and built under the leadership of the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Katlenburg-Lindau, Germany, with significant contributions by DLR German Aerospace Center, Institute of Planetary Research, Berlin, and in coordination with the Institute of Computer and Communication Network Engineering, Braunschweig. The framing camera project is funded by the Max Planck Society, DLR, and NASA/JPL.
