<h3>Caption:</h3>

<p>
 The islands are the Galapagos, situated in the Pacific Ocean roughly 1000 
kilometers west of mainland Ecuador. The image is oriented with north 
toward the bottom and was acquired during Terra orbit 9878.
</p>
<p>
 The answers to this quiz appear in blue below each question.
</p>
<p>
 1. There are no endemic species of cactus on any of the islands.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: FALSE
  <br/>
  Endemic genera of cacti include Brachycereus and Jasminocereus, the lava 
and candelabra cactus, respectively.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 2. Flamingos, whose diets include crustaceans, tiny fish, and algae, can be found 
wading in brackish lagoons.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: TRUE
  <br/>
  Greater flamingos are primarily seen on Floreana and other southern islands.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 3. A change in ocean temperature associated with an episodic disruption in atmospheric 
circulation led to a precipitous decline in the local penguin population.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: TRUE
  <br/>
  The Galapagos penguin population declined alarmingly during 1972 and 1998, when 
nutrients and fish were less abundant due to warmer surface waters associated with 
an El Ni&#241;o event.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 4. Discovery of the islands is generally attributed to a 16th century Spanish missionary 
whose vessel veered off its intended course.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: TRUE
  <br/>
  The islands were officially discovered in 1535 by the Spanish missionary Fray Tomas de 
Berlanga, the Bishop of Panama. His ship veered off course while on a journey from 
Panama to what is now Peru.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 5. A recurring and dramatic geological event took place on the westernmost island in 
1988, 1991 and 1995, causing injury or death to over 2,000 people.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: FALSE
  <br/>
  The volcano of the westernmost island of Fernandina erupted 1988, 1991 and 1995, but 
there are no permanent human settlements on this island.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 6. Several plant species are endangered due to decimation by goats and competition with 
non-native vegetation.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: TRUE
  <br/>
  Invasive plants such as quinine and guava trees, and invasive animals such as goats, 
feral cattle, and the cottony cushion scale insect are contributing to the endangered 
status of native plant species such as the endemic daisy tree and the Floreana flax.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 7. Within the archipelago there are at least half a dozen freshwater lakes with diameters 
exceeding 250 meters.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: FALSE
  <br/>
  El Junco Lake on San Cristobal island (at 270 meters in diameter) is the only large 
freshwater lake in the Galapagos archipelago.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 8. A particular endangered animal sub-species is survived by a single male, and attempts 
at breeding have so far proved unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: TRUE
  <br/>
  The Pinta island subspecies of Galapagos Giant Tortoise (Geochelone elephantopus 
abingdoni) are survived by a single male named "Lonesome George". Attempts to mate 
Lonesome George with female tortoises of the closest subspecies have not been successful.
 </font>
</p>
<p>
 9. Chapter 13 of a book written in the mid-nineteenth century by a native of Shrewsbury, 
England is primarily concerned with the islands of this archipelago.
</p>
<p>
 <font color="#0000FF">
  Answer: FALSE
  <br/>
  Naturalist Charles Darwin (a native of Shrewsbury, England) recounted his explorations in 
"Voyage of the Beagle", but it is Chapter 17 of this book that focuses on the Galapagos. 
(Note: After publishing this quiz it was discovered that Chapter 13 of the 6th edition of 
Darwin's "Origin of Species" also briefly discusses the Galapagos, so TRUE is also accepted.)
