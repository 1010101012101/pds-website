<h3>Caption:</h3>

<p>
 This view of Titan's south pole reveals the intriguing dark feature named 
Ontario Lacus and a host of smaller features dotting the south polar region.
</p>
<p>
 The true nature of this feature, seen here at left of center, is not yet known 
with absolute certainty. However, the feature's darkness, the shore-like 
smoothness of its perimeter, and its presence in an area where frequent 
convective storm clouds have been observed by Cassini and Earth-based 
astronomers made it the best candidate for an open body of liquid on Titan 
when this image was taken in June 2005.
</p>
<p>
 This interpretation has been strengthened by the sighting of features having 
similar morphologies in Titan's northern polar region during the flyby of Titan 
in late February (see
 <a href="/catalog/PIA08365">
  PIA08365
 </a>
 ). The possibility that these northern features, 
the sizes of small seas, are either completely or partially filled with liquid 
hydrocarbons is significantly strengthened by Cassini radar data that overlap 
portions of the Imaging Science Subsystem-observed northern bodies, (see
 <a href="/catalog/PIA09182">
  PIA09182
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 Previously, scientists had speculated that Ontario Lacus might simply be a 
broad depression filled by dark, solid hydrocarbons falling from the atmosphere 
onto Titan's surface. In this case, the smoothed outline might be the result of 
a process unrelated to rainfall, such as a sinkhole or a volcanic caldera. 
However, the strong likelihood that the northern polar features are lakes and 
seas has made imaging scientists more confident that Ontario Lacus, and the 
smaller dark features dotting the southern polar region of Titan, also hold liquid. 
If correct, this new revelation would mean that each pole on Titan is a large 
wetlands area.
</p>
<p>
 The feature is named for Lake Ontario because its shape and length are similar, 
though the Titan feature is much wider. In actual surface area, the feature is 
roughly the size of Lake Victoria. However, if the relative sizes of Titan and 
Earth are accounted for, Ontario Lacus covers roughly the same fraction of 
Titan as does the Black Sea on Earth.
</p>
<p>
 A red cross below the center in the scene marks the pole. The brightest features 
seen here are methane clouds. A movie sequence showing the evolution of bright 
clouds in the region during the same flyby is also available (see
 <a href="/catalog/PIA06241">
  PIA06241
 </a>
 ).
</p>
<p>
 This view is a composite of three narrow-angle camera images, taken over 
several minutes during Cassini's distant June 6, 2005, flyby. The images were 
combined to produce a sharper view of Titan's surface. The images were taken 
using a combination of spectral filters sensitive to wavelengths of polarized 
infrared light. The images were acquired from approximately 450,000 kilometers 
(279,000 miles) from Titan. Resolution in the scene is approximately 3 kilometers 
(2 miles) per pixel. The view has been contrast enhanced to improve the overall 
visibility of surface features.

<h3>Background Info:</h3>

<p>
 The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European 
Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, manages 
the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The 
Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and 
assembled at JPL. The imaging team is based at the Space Science 
Institute, Boulder, Colo.
